=== Sketches/low/medium/high fidelity prototypes

In early design sketching == prototyping

* Low fidelity prototypes have few details but they are useful to start with
** post it notes, storyboards, cardboard cutouts
** interface design
*** Paper prototypes are quick and cheap
** keeping them basic encourages users to focus on high level concepts
* Medium fidelity are a bit more refined
** digital prototypes that don't require large time/money investments
** usability testing (idea debugging and refinement)
** propose an interface
** run heuristic evaluations
** conduct usability testing
* High fidelity prototypes
** provide a working system
** conduct limited field testing
** alpha/beta testing

== Sketches

Sketches are:

* Quick
* Timely
* Disposable
* Plentiful
** More is more
* Clear vocabulary
* Constrained resolution
* Consistency with state
* Suggest and explore rather than confirm

You want to explore as many ideas as possible as quickly and as cheaply as possible

=== Storyboarding

A series of key frames as sketches (like in films)

* snapshots of the interface at particular points in the interaction

Even if basic and simple the user understands how the UI works

If they see something they like/don't like they can tell you and you can change it easily

Tutorials can be used as storyboards

* A step by step storyboard walkthrough with detailed explanations

== Medium fidelity prototypes

Digital prototypes that simulate some (not all) features of the interface

* engaging for the user

[CAUTION]  
.Dangers of mid-fi
====
* Users focus on details but not bigger picture
* Users reluctant to challenge designer
* Users reluctant to touch the design
* Management may think its real
====

=== Limiting prototpye functionality

Vertical prototypes:

* very finalized mockups of some functionalities
* only one/very few screens with all their subscreens and such

Horizontal prototypes:

* not very finalized mockups of all functionalities
* all main screens but no subscreens

Scenario:

* scripted events for testing

=== Scripted simulations

Create storyboard with media tools

* scene transition activated by simple 
user inputs
* a simple vertical prototype

User given a very tight script/task to 
follow

* appears to behave as a real system
* script deviations blow the simulation

=== Interface builders

Design tools for laying out common widgets

Excellent for showing look and feel

* a broader horizontal prototype
* but constrained to widget library

Vertical functionality added selectively

* through programming


=== Wizard of Oz

A method for testing a system that doesn't exist

There is an operator (the wizard) that interacts on the other end

* the operator follows a script
* useful for simulating vertical functionalities


The user thinks that's the final system

i.e. prototyping ChatGPT but instead of an LLM you have a human on the other end
