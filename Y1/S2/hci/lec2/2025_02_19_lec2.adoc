== Gestural Interfaces

* Useful for public spaces
** So that people don't touch or damage it
** Also for accessibility
*** People in wheelchairs don't need to go up to touch the screen

=== Issues with (and solutions to) Touchless gestural Interfaces

* legacy bias
** you have to learn a whole new medium
* immediate usability
** how do you activate a touchless screen?
*** get a sample of people and see what they come up with

=== Usability indices

* NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX)
** standard questionnaire validated on thousands of users
* One study showed that all NASA TLX measures are lower when avatars are present (good)
** p = 0.07 (lol)
* when there was no activation gesture (sit on icon for 3s) people used both hands

== User centered design

* Norman described it as a "philosophy based on the needs and interests of the user"
* emphasis on making products usable and understandable

4 elements of UCD:

. Place the user at the center of design
. Involve the user
. Integrate knowledge/expertise from different HCI fields
. High interactivity

There are multiple paradigms

* Breadcrumb paradigm
** Follow the steps to complete some procedure
** Ideally should be a way to go back, not cancel outright
** People often forget things they don't use
** go back should be easily remembered unlike Rewind in the Paper app

=== Problems in traditional software development

* Software engineering treats users as inputs/outputs
* Focuses on large batch processed systems
* Importance of users is forgotten
** Waterfall model is very common
*** Puts design near the end (bad)
** Spiderweb model also exists
*** includes prototyping (better)
*** still too rigid

HCI approach/star life cycle

Do a bit of:

* implementation
* task/functional analyisis
* requirements specifications
* conceptual/formal design
* prototyping

at every iteration

=== UCD Process

Design is based upon users':

* abilities and real needs
** you want to write documents, not learn an interface
* context
** where is this software/system used? factory/office/home/hospital
* work
** consider the work environment and interface performance
* tasks
** what does the software/system need to do? what do users want it to do?
* need for a usable and useful products

Assumptions:

* good design leads to satisfied customers
* design processes require designers and customers to collaborate
* constant communication between designers and customers

==== Methods for involving the user

* talk to users
** many designers don't
** beware subconscious needs/requirements
** beware idiot customers as well
** explain the design
*** describe what you're going to do
*** get input at all design stages
** have visuals/demos
*** people react differently to verbal explanations
*** prototypes are critical

* contextual interviews+site visits
** interview users their workplace while they're working
** discover their culture, requirements, expectations


==== Participatory design

End users participate actively in all phases of the design process

Problems

* Intuitions can be wrong
* Interviews are not accurate
* Designers don't know users sufficiently well to deeply understand their requirements

Solution

* designers should have access to representative users
** *END USERS*, not their managers

End users are considered subject matter experts

There are ups and downs

Ups:

* users react well to suggested system designs
** designs must be complete
* users bring in important knowledge
* greater buy-in rate

Downs:

* hard to get a good pool of users
* users are not expert designers
* users are not always right
** they often don't know what they want
