== App design

Apps:

self contained programs
deal with a specific function
provide a specific function
use code
made for specific devices

=== Responsive websites

Responsive websites are kind of like web apps that only require one webdev team instead of 2 dedicated app teams (Apple & Android)

=== Native and hybrid apps

Use system tools to simplify the user's life

* Location services
** Know when close to pharmacy
* Purchasing channels
** Buy straight from app
* Sensors
** touching screen/shaking/rotating do different things
* Multimedia
** Images and video tutorials
* Notifications
** Notify that meds are low
* Social connections
** connect with other users/caretakers/whoever
