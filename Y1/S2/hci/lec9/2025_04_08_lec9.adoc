== Overview

=== Research question

take Android keyboard or iPhone keyboard

* *which keyboard is faster to type on?*

This can be answered in whole

* Android is faster

Can be answered in part/under certain circumstances

* Android is faster in low light

Rejected as unanswerable

* Depends entirely on user skill

Only an apparent problem

* who cares if Android/iPhone keyboard is faster

RQs test one or more hypotheses

=== Hypothesis vs Theory

Hypotheses are testable proposed explanations for a phenomenon with a logical consequence

Working hypotheses are temporarily accepted as a basis for further research

Theory is a generalized thought about a phenomenon

=== Hypothesis Types

Usual suspects

* null H0 = no difference
* alternative H1 = there is some difference
** can have more (H1, H2, H3, ...)
** can be directional (H1a, H1b)

== Operationalization of Concepts

=== 5 whats

Analogous to 5 whys

. What is the RQ
. What is the hypothesis
. What is the correct hypothesis test
. What are the independent variables?
* Is the factor within/between participants?
. What are the dependent variables?
* What is being measured?
* Objective/subjective measure?
** performance, usability, fun, immersion, fitness, health, etc.

=== Subjective measures need concepts

Can't use overly general terms like health

* split into more specific and measurable concepts
** e.g. physical health, mental health, etc.

Subterms need to be defined clearly

For example:

* H1: iPhone users type fast
** bad
** fast is meaningless
* H1: iPhone users have higher typing performance than Android users
** better
** things are defined

Typing performance needs to be operationalized:

* measurement variables
** WPM
** backspace presses
* derived variables
** error rate
** whatever bs

=== Testing With Multiple Measures

Sometimes not sure if measures are correlated or not

* WPM and CPM are probably related so can expect correlations
* need to separate them (for some reason??)

== Error Types

4 types:

.Type I error

False positive: we see an effect where there isn't one

* rejecting H0 when it's true

.Type II error

False negative: we don't see an effect when there is one

* not rejecting H0 when it's false

.Type III error

Wrong hypothesis but right answer

* something wrong with hypothesis formulation

.Type IV error

Right hypothesis but wrong answer

* used wrong test with correct hypothesis


I and II are test errors

III and IV are researcher errors

Type I is generally worse but depends on the effect of the error and about a morbillion other factors

=== Sub 3

== Methods for increasing statistical power
