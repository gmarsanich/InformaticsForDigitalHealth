== What is user experience?

=== Creating Interactive Systems

Focus on experience

UI is only part of the system 

* Dont focus only on functionality
* Focus on accessibility
** Customization
** Preferences
** Use cases/use context

== UX documentation

=== Statement of Requirements

* Written document
* Defines project requirements (no shit)
* Acts as a reference point during project
* Helps set the project scope
* Agreed to and signed off by all stakeholders _before_ the project begins
* Identifies risk

For instance:

* Project name, date, VCS
* Project owner, sponsors and stakeholders
* Project scope and objectives
* Completion requirements
* Deliverables
* Timelines/milestones
* Cost estimate
* Assumptions and risk assessment

=== Personas

Set of profiles (based on research) that provides a slice of the prospective userbase

* Keep them general
** 3-5 personas usually enough
* interview prospective users
* capture patterns of user attitudes
* Focus on:
** key goals
*** userbase-wide
*** more specific goals
** user behaviors
** attitudes

=== Scenarios

Identify keys/goals

A scenario is a paragraph (100-200 words)

Writing multiple scenarios can describe the product more clearly

Key questions:

// blud is yapping n saying nothing

* Why?
* How?
* When?
* Where?
** consider where the product will be used

==== Scenarios for prototyping

Creating prototypes for specific scenarios

Vertical slice of a horizontal prototype

=== Task analysis

Helps us address design guidelines:

* speak the users language
** dont confuse the user
* be consistent
** strike a balance between novelty and familiarity
** fit the users' existing use case(s)
* give appropriate feedback
** penis and balls sack

Form prototypical tasks/user attitudes

Collapse how users perform a given task into our new experience (???)

Analyzes people's jobs(???)

* what they do
* what they work with
* what they need to know

Focuses on the user

Examines external actions instead of reading the user's state of mind



==== Phases of task analysis

Iterative process

. Defining purpose and scope
* what tasks are we analyzing? in what detail?
* look at goals of personas (find common tasks and individual tasks)
. Obtaining data
* get prior data
** interviews (how do you complete this task?)
** documentation
** ethnographic observation
. Extracting activity lists
* identify key tasks and actions
. Organizing and describing task performance
* parallelizing task processes
* optimizing
. Confirming
* make sure your analyisis is accurate
. Use the results in analysis/evaluation


==== Task analysis in the design process

If you know what task needs doing you can design a solution that solves that task (??????????)

Use it to evaluate the solution during prototyping

* does my solution solve the task?
** yes/no/kinda

==== Human-task-computer relationships

The computer should help the user achieve a task

Taking into account the *domain*/*context* where the interaction takes place

=== Task Models

=== User Journey

=== Site Map

=== Wireframes

=== Design Visualizations

== Evaluating the user experience
