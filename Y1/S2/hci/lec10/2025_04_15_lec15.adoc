== Role Of The Design Brief 

Contains project definition:

. Problem to solve
. Target audience
. Goals
. Success criteria
. Constraints
. Deliverables

Frames challenge

Anchor ideation in user needs

Required to solve the right problem

Keeps project vision focused and aligned

Prevents jumping to conclusions

=== Design Briefs in UX

Focus on:

. user needs
. experience
. goals
. use case

Good design briefs have a structure:

. Project
* what's the focus of this project
. Problem
* what issue are we solving
. Audience
* who are the users?
. Scope
* what do we include/exclude?
* avoids overdoing/bloating
. Constraitnt
* what limits do we need to follow
* budget, time
. Goal
* what *measurable* outcome are we aiming for?

=== Writing Effective Briefs

Phrase the problem instead of the solution

Be specific

Involve stakeholders early 

Make success measurable

Be clear but not oppressive

Refer to the brief during ideation

== Generating Ideas And Solutions - Ideation

Creative process for generating many ideas

Encourages designers to explore ideas before converging

.Divergent Techniques
* Generating many ideas with no judgement 
* Brainstorming
* Brainwriting
* Mind mapping
* Sketching/crazy 8s
* Bodystorming
* SCAMPER
** Modify existing idea with new memes
* Worst Possible Ideas

.Convergent Techniques
* Filter divergent ideas into actionable ideas
* Dot Voting
* Feasibility Impact Matrix
* Embrace Opposites
* 3-way comparisons
* Affinity Mapping
* Six Thinking Hats

Helps learn to be creative on command

Good briefs generate user focused ideation questions

Problems should become *how might we ...?* questions

* how might we help users avoid emergency refills?
* how might we decrease task completion times?

Not all ideas survive the filter

* kill gracefully
* pivot

== Team Techniques

Often good to do these things solo and then in teams

* go deep solo
* discuss solo solutions in groups
* parallel convergence

Groups/teams bring in diversity and different viewpoints

Good ideation sessions use one or more of the following:

* Set visual tone (sticky notes, whiteboards, sketch pads)
* Have a warmup round
* Use prompts to kickstart idea generation
* Take a break before filtering
