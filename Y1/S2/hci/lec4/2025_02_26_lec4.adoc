== Human Factors

=== Present Situation

People learn to use things that are inconvenient

* QWERTY is unergonomic but we learned to use it

== Goals of System Engineering

* serve users
* design effective systems
* good interface design makes interface invisible
* allow for maintenance
* minimize
** skill 
** personnel requirement
** training time

=== Main issues in design

* proper functionality
** task analysis is central
* reliability, availability security and data integrity
** across commands
* standardization, integration, consistency and portability
** cross platform
* schedules and budgets

=== Cognitive and perceptual abilities

Ergonomics abstract

* Short term memory
** humans have bad short term memory (generally)
** we can recall 5-9 chunks of information (e.g. strings of 5-9 numbers)
** long lists of menus are hard to memorize
*** split into submenus
* Long term memory is related to learning
** can't assume the user will use their long term memory unless longitudinal studies
* Attention
** drive the user to pay attention to specific parts of the interface
* Search and scanning
** Make it easy to find things while scanning
* Time perception
** Theory of flow
** Don't distract the user from their task (keep them in flow)

=== Factors affecting perceptual and motor performance
 
* Fatigue
** fatigue is important *especially* in critical infrastructure 
** keep minimal interface during critical moments

rest doesnt matter i guess

=== Personality differences

People have different preferences:

* interaction styles
* pace of interaction
* graphics vs text
* desnse vs sparse interface
* step by step vs all at once

in critical moments you generally don't want step by step

=== Cultural/international diversity

Cultural/racial/ethnic/linguistic background

UI design requires internationalization:

* characters/numerals/special characters
* text direction
* date/time formats
* numerical/currency formats
* phone numbers
* addresses
* names and titles
* identification
* penis and cock and dick
* sorting sequences
* icons/buttons/colors
* pluralization/grammar/spelling
* etiquette/policies/vagina and labia and tits

=== Users with disabilities

most disabilities can be accomodated for

* TTS
* speech recognition
* eye gaze control
* special IO devices
* head mounted optical mice
* brain computer interface (lol)

=== Elderly users

Fat finger problem

* fingers swell with age
** small buttons are hard to press
** make big button
* bad vision
** bright colors and easy shapes (?)
