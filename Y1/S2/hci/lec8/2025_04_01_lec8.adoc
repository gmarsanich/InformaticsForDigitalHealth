== Usability testing

=== What is it?

Evaluating an app/service/prototype by testing it directly on the target audience

=== Why usability testing?

Used to identify usabilty issues and areas for improvement

To find problems that developers haven't thought of

== What is usability?

How easy to use is an interface for a particular set of users?

Defined by 5 main quality components:

* Learnability: how easy is it for users to complete their goal the first time they use the app
* Efficiency: how quickly can users perform tasks once they have learned?
* Memorability: how easily can users reestablish proficiency after not using the app for a while? 
* Errors: how many errors do users make? how severe are they? how do users recover?
* Satisfaction: how pleasant is it to use the app?

=== Usability vs utility

Utility: does the app provide the features you need?

Have to test for functionality as well

* It doesn't matter if app is easy to do if it doesn't do what you want
* It doesn't matter if app does what you want if it's really hard to do 

=== Users and usability testing

Testing if principles of human centered design are met

Usability testing sessions are when a researcher (*facilitator*) asks a participant to perform tasks using one or more specific interfaces

.Facilitator tasks

. give instructions
. answer user questions
. ask follow up questions
. acquire high quality test results
. acquire valid data
. do *NOT* influence the user
. ask users to think aloud
.. do *NOT* interrupt or intervene

After the session the facilitator gets the user's feedback

=== Heuristic evaluations

3-5 researchers pre evaluate their app but also questions to ask users

==== Nielsen's usability heuristics

. Visibility of system status
* timely feedback about what's going on in the back
* e.g. progress bars, you-are-here dots on map
. Match between system and real world
* use language/concepts familiar to the user
* drag and drop file into folder
. User control and freedom
* help users undo their mistakes easily
* cancel/undo buttons
. Consistency and standards
* follow conventions, don't reinvent the wheel
. Error Prevention
* prevent problems where possible
* e.g. prefill a form with standard placeholder values
. Recognition > recall
* help the users recognize interface items rather than remember them
. Flexibility and efficiency of use
* provide shortcuts for experienced users
. Aesthetic and minimalist design
* Show relevant information only
. Recognize+diagnose+recover from errors
.. Express errors in plain language
.. Indicate the problem
.. Suggest a solution
. Help and documentation
* if all else fails point them to a book


=== Types of usability testing

2 main types

* Qualitative
** observational findings (notes from thinking aloud, etc.)
* Quantitative
** metric dependent
** task completion rate
** task time
** number of errors

== How to plan usability tests

=== Tasks

Realistic activities that participants might perform in real life

Specific > open ended

.Task examples:

* add new medication
* confirm taking medication
* export medication list

Wording is very important

* minor variations can influence the participant

=== Goals

What is the goal of this test?

Points to qualitative/quantitative/both

Usually initial prototype is mostly qualitative

=== Format

Lab vs field

* participant comes to you or you go to participant

Moderated vs unmoderated

* are you there physically or not?

In-person or remote?

* in person easier to take notes
** easier to interact
* remote easer to not bias the user

=== Number of participants

Qualitative:

* 5 people is good enough according to Nielsen Norman Group

Quantitative:

* 20 is the bare minimum
* for statistical validity

=== Recruitment

Find people similar to personas or people that can simulate the personas

== What tools are there?
