== Common TTPs of modern ransomware groups

Kaspersky ransomware report lists common ransomware techniques used by some gangs

Most use the same techniques

* BITS jobs is uncommon
** abusing cronjobs/scheduled tasks
* Phising is not that common
* All attack external remote services
* All run malicious scripts
** only a few troll the users to run malicious executables
* Most abuse account systems to increase privileges
** only one uses privilege escalation exploits

== MITRE Tools

=== Caldera

FOSS framework developed by MITRE

Used to create adversary emulation plans

* offensive platform
* basically attacker training

Attackers specify attack techniques

MITRE was scared shitless that real attackers could use it

* it was neutered to make it less dangerous
* premade agents were required to be installed on the victims
* C2 told agents to do/simulate various tasks

Had a planner that was used to plan (lol) and generate attacks

* apparently very good

Then Caldera II came out

* shit planner
* plugin based

=== Cascade

C2 tool to analyze attack infrastructure made by MITRE

* based on ATT&CK matrix

=== D3FEND

Defense matrix made of a few high level defense tactics

* attacker specific

Used the following defense techniques/classes:

. Model
* know your system
** build inventory
. Hardening
* reduces attack surface
** increase checks
** reduce vulnerabilities
. Detection
* discovering attacks
** IDS/EDR/YARA/firewalls
. Isolation
* putting compromised hosts in quarantine
. Deception
* honeypots
** can be dangerous if not properly isolated
. Eviction
* get rid of attacker and their tools
. Restore
* have a (few) backup(s)

=== EMB3D

Framework for defending embedded devices

* sensors
* actuators
* software memes
* whatever the fuck

Overview:

. Enumerates defects/vulnerabilities on embedded devices
. Checks if those defects have associated attacks
. Deploys (or checks) mitigations

Builds glossary of security problems/solutions for device owners/operators and security providers

* basically stadndardized language (e.g. ISO)

== Reacting to Intrusions

Prevention is best but shit happens

2 kinds of reactions:

. Target system reaction
* something has to change on that system
. Intrusion source reaction
* counterattacks are pretty much useless
** C2 infrastructure is made up of victims (botnets and such)
** mapping the C2 infrastructure is much more useful

=== Incident Response

[start=0]
. Preparation
* hardening
* adversary emulation is important here
** *ADVERSARY EMULATIONS ARE NOT PENETRATION TESTS*
** prunes intrusion/attack tree
* all the usual stuff
. Identification
* what's happening
* where is it happening
* where is it going
. Containment + escalation
* limit impact of incident
** quarantine: block host at firewall level
** string matching: filter connections based on stringL
** connection throttling: limit number of host connections
** prevent him from moving forward with his attack
* inform victims
* establish reparation activities
. Analysis+eradication
* find attacker traces
* look through logs
* remove malicious software (lol)
* *COLLECT EVIDENCE AND KEEP IT SAFE*
** sign evidence and timestamp
. Recovery
. Lessons learned
* what went wrong?
* what can we improve?

=== Forensics

Involving lawyers/judges

. Call police/lawyers/incident response
. Copy memory, processes, files, active connections
. Power down (!)
* unplug without shutting down
* there might be some funny memes in the shutdown process that deletes evidence
. Copy disk
. Analyze copied images

=== Logs as an eradication + forensics source

Logs are very important

Save these things:

. Successful logins
. Failed logins
. Access to critical resources
. Anomalous messages
* network traffic peaks
* extreme disk IO ops
. Error messages

WARNING: PROTECT LOGS AT ALL COSTS

. save them to write once memory
* shrimply print to paper
* write to CD
. insert a sequence number
* every time a log is produced it has a sequence number
** don't use trivial sequences (1234)
** use PSEUDO RNG to generate seq otherwise can't predict next number
. create blockchain (lol)
* each block has hash of previous block + hash of current block + hash of next block

CAUTION: these things (except blockchains) only tell you if log has been tampered with, not what was in it

Used to monitor system but also in trial to prosecute attacker/defend yourself from cringe CEOs

What if my log file is full? (??? how can it be full :sob:)

* if it gets too big it can slow the system down

. Throw it away (don't)
. Reset (rotate within file)
. Compress and archive

== Automating Simple Intrusions

Intrusions can be pretty complicated

Attackers tend to automate them to save themselves the headache


=== Worms

The only real automated malware are worms

* spreads on its own without attack infrastructure
** unless the attacker has a specific requirement
** often used to build one

Many kinds of worms:

* email
** inside message
** inside attachment
* IRC
* Instant Messages
* File sharing
** hidden in file
* Internet/network worms through wormable vulnerabilities
** some vulnerability that enables code execution on a remote node

.worm process structure (naive scheme)
. Generates random IP address/email address/whatever required for task
. Checks if IP address is used
.. If used probe for vulnerabilities
.. If vulnerable attack
.. If successful spread
. Else try again

Real worms are much more insidious

Conficker (old worm) is a bit more involved

* does specific geolocation checks
* checks for specific processes
* uses domain flux
** makes a ton of DNS requests in a short time to find its C2 node
** good defenders can notice this and take action

Worms obfuscate their code (as all good malware does)

They can also have sandbox detection systems that upload a fake payload

* often the real payload is a tor client

=== Domain Flux

Assigns many domains to a single IP address and rotates them rapidly to hide the C2 node's IP address

Worms have algorithms to generate domain names

.Optimizing address generation
* Density -> probability that a random address in a set corresponds to a real node
* Local (high density) -> similar to domain of infected node
* Global (low density) -> completely random
* If the ratio of local addresses and global addresses is:
** too low: the worm can be detected
** too high: the worm can infect the same node multiple times
* small changes can have large effects

Not all worms use IP addresses

* some use logical addresses
** email addresses
** whatever

=== Theoretical Spreading Model

Theoretically we can model the spreading of worms epidemiologically

* i.e. as if it were a real disease (obviously simplfied)

Expressed as cyclical finite state

.Model states
* S: Susceptible to disease
* I: infected
* R: Recovered
* S can become R by vaccination
** hardening the system
* S can also become I and then R
** becoming infected
** recovering system
* R systems can become S to new worm/disease

Can be expressed as differential equations (1927 study btw)

* assumes a node can infect any other node

.Epidemiology meme
[stem]
++++
\frac{d \mathit{s}}{d \mathit{t}} = - \beta si

\\

\frac{d \mathit{i}}{d \mathit{t}} = \beta si - \gamma i

\\

\frac{d \mathit{r}}{d \mathit{t}} = \gamma i
++++

Change in S is -infection rate * potentially infected * infected

Change in I is infection rate

//slides xd

This system doesn't have an exact solution but we can approximate it if initial stem:[I] is low (near 0)

* usually safe bet

.Solutions
[stem]
++++
//math memes
++++

The solution is a logistic curve with 3 main phases:

. slow start
. epidemic phase
* rapid growth
. slow finish
* some nodes/people are hard to infect for whatever reasons
** nodes are behind like 12 firewalls and 6 routers and such

The infection spreads slowly at the start so worms should be detected and removed ASAP (no shit?)

Worms are too quick to recover from so stem:[\gamma] isn't usually taken into consideration

.In our case:
* stem:[\beta] is a function of:
** the IP address generation function
** the number of systems affected by the vulnerabilities
** the higher it is the more virulent
* stem:[\gamma] should not be ignored any time
** the spread is relatively slow
** patching can be automated
** there are automated countermeasures/mitigations

The stem:[\beta] value of worm can be computed:

.Worm stem:[\beta]
[stem]
++++
\beta = \frac{C}{N} \cdot \frac{\alpha}{\tau}
++++

Where:

* stem:[C] is some magical parameter

.Epidemiological Threshold
stem:[R_0 = \frac{\beta \sigma}{\gamma}] is indicator of spread

* if stem:[R_0 \lt 1] the disease is reducing
* if stem:[R_0 \gt 1] the disease is spreading

There is another model that takes patching into consideration

* requires changing the state model
* adding P
** P = patching

There is another even more complex model with 8 states (lol)

==== Topologies

We need to take topologies into consideration because we dont all live in a net

* the less connected a population/network is the slower the spread

.Scale free (the rich get richer)
* When a new node is connected to a network connecting to a hub with many connections is preferred
* Few hubs with many connections
* Many nodes with few connections
* likely the topology of the Internet
* Strong against random attacks and faults
* Weak against targeted attacks
** cutting an undersea cable can disrupt many devices
