== Analyzing Intrusions

Understanding what attackers can do is required to be able to stop them

Can't blindly use IDS/EDR/NDR on raw attack data

* have to know what intrusions these attacks enable

*HOWEVER*

Stopping a single attack in the chain then that intrusion is no longer possible

* attackers could attack again I guess

WARNING: blocking a few intrusions can make the attackers' life easier by reducing their uncertainty

Have to consider the entire system

=== Attack/Intrusion Graphs

Directed graph that describes how an attacker can reach a certain goal in a given system

This graph is acyclic (unless attacker is stupid or makes a mistake)

* Graph doesn't draw failures
** It doesn't draw useless attacks either
* Assumes initial access is successful
* Graph can become horrendously complicated
** multiple attackers with multiple goals
** real systems with many nodes also very annoying to represent

.What does it do?
* Each node of the graph has a set of rights that the attacker has at that node
** other than the first node (all legal) all nodes require illegal actions to escalate privileges
* acquiring privilege escalation requires chicanery
** buffer overflow against Node 25 Operating System
* no link without a vulnerability
* if link then attack preconditions are fulfilled
* if attack is successful then number of rights are those from previous node + postcondition

.Attack Graph Properties
* Monotonic granting of rights since doesn't represent defense
* No self loops since failures aren't represented

=== Attack Trees

Simplified attack graph

Intrusions are leaves of a tree

Each node is a single attack or a chain (complex attack)

Still massively complicated to compute and represent

== How To Build an Intrusion

Attack graphs can represent 1000s of possible attack paths

Real attackers may only pick one (for a variety of reasons)

* *Adversary emulation* is used to prune the graph to focus on specific attackers

Defenders know (in theory) the attack graph because they know the system and its vulnerabilities

Attackers don't know these things (ideally)

* they can't build an attack graph beforehand
* they have to attack something first
* the things they know depend on the rights they have at a given time
* attackers *collect* info before *exploiting* vulnerabilities
** their success depends on the balance between collecting and exploiting
** these things take time
** defenders need time to deploy countermeasures

== Stopping Intrusions/Attackers

By blocking the path from one node to another in an attack graph we stop aanothern intrusion based on a given attack

Attackers can also try again

There can be multiple paths from one node to another

* blocking the source of the fork is more efficient than blocking 2 paths

There are useless attacks as well

* blocking them is useless because they wouldn't help the attacker anyway
* blocking useful attacks is the most important thing to do
* some attacks might not be blockable
** too expensive
** impractical
** whatever
* have to find alternative attacks that reach the same goal to block
** or block entrance in the first place

== Automating Intrusions

Modern AI are good at building single attacks

Not good at building chains

* humans still required for that

== Attacker actions

=== Persistence

Attackers can carve out a nook in the system and sit there

* trojan
* backdoor
* making an account

They do this for a variety of reasons

* building a botnet
* restarting intrusion from checkpoint if interrupted/caught
* collecting more info
* generally being a nuisance

The tools they install communicate with the C2 infrastructure

* often multiple parts of C2 infrastructure to reduce noise
* addresses hidden in plain sight in public blockchains
* DNS requests are abused to send info
** is detectable

=== Evasion

Dodging defense mechanisms

* IDS
* EDR
* NDR

Many ways to dodge:

* Encrypting messages
* Fragmenting single message in multiple packets
* Rebuilding messages
* Sending fake messages
** using wrong ECC
* Token manipulation to avoid authentication
* Running malware on container
** dodges host IDS
** calls are made on/by container
** IDS has no real idea

=== Mitre attack matrix

Not actually a matrix

Database that stores information about attacker actions

* has pre attack info
** building C2
** gathering info
* one for most system types
** PRE
*** pre attack matrix
** enterprise (Linux, Windows, macOS, networks)
** ICS (industrial machinery)
** mobile (Android/iOS)
** cloud (massively pruned of all malware)
** containers (even more pruned)
* columns are objectives (persistence, execution, ...)
* rows of a column are techniques

Describes possible intrusion steps but not whole intrusions

No real info about attacker strategy

* says nothing about order of tactics
* just says what attackers can do
* focuses on tactic detection

*TTPs* are keys that map certain actions to somewhere in the matrix

* MITRE defense matrix maps techniques to possible countermeasures

=== Cyber Kill Chain

Developed by Lockheed-Martin (LOL)

Has 7 stages:

. Reconnaissance
* same as MITRE
. Weaponization
* building malware
. Delivery
* putting malware on victim system
. Exploitation
* abusing vulnerabilitities
. Installation
* installing the malware on the victim
. Command and Control
* setting up C2
. Actions and Objectives
* perform chicanery

Sequential description of attacker behavior

Lacks information collection

Kinda just cringe overall

=== Tactics

First 3 are mandatory

. Reconnaissance
* gathering info on potential victim
** what OS it's using
** what ports are open
** whatever
** scanning
** web searches
** website analysis
. Resource development
* establishing resources to attack
** building C2
** writing loaders
** writing payloads
*** in reality they can often be bought
** making accounts
** compromising accounts
. Initial access
* getting into the network/machine
** attacking exposed applications
** phishing/spear phishing
** adding hardware devices
*** planting malware USB drives somewhere
** supply chain attacks
. Execution
* acquiring rights and running code
** running system interpreter (bash, PowerShell)
** deploying a container to troll IDS
** running RAT, trojan, whatever
. Persistence
* maintaining foothold in the system
** making account
** adding components to bootloader
*** TPM should counter this
. Privilege escalation
* abusing elevation control mechanisms
** attacking `su`/`sudo`/`doas`/ Run as Administrator
** exploitation for privileges
** process injection
** escape to host
*** leaving VM and running on bare metal
. Defense evasion
* Dodging countermeasures
** abusing privileges (admins dodge checks by default)
** Deploying containers/VMs
** Manipulating indicators of compromise
** attacking IDS directly
. Credential access
* obtaining credentials
** keylogging
** phishing
. Discovery
* exploring the system
* understanding what they can/can't do with current rights
. Lateral movement
* accessing another node in a network
. Collection
* by this point the attacker already has the rights they need
* gathering target data
. Command & Control (C2)
* messages between victim and attacker's infrastructure
. Exfiltration
* stealing target data
. Impact
* manipulating the victim in some way
** deleting files
** deleting registry entries
** deleting software
** encrypting with ransomware

Strategy involves some ordering of these tactics

* attack matrix doesn't describe this

=== ICS Attack Matrix

Typically no exfiltration because no data saved on machinery

* information on machinery can be manipulated but generally no point stealing it

*Greater focus on impact*

ICS machines have safety systems built in that don't go through network

* mechanical shutoff systems
* automatic warnings

Attackers can send false information to operator screens to fool them into blowing up their system

=== APT3

Advanced Persistent Threats group
* Has like 12 aliases
* Based in China

Some known attacks:

* Operation Clandestine Wolf
* Operation Clandestine Fox
* Operation Double Tap

Often attacks high tech/industrial companies

* Exfiltrates documents, intellectual property and such
* Attacks printers, file shares, whatever
