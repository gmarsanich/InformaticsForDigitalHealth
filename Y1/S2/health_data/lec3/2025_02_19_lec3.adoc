== Access Control


=== Discretionary Access Control

* Each object has an owner
** the whole IT system
** the business process that uses the object

the owner is entirely free to do whatever

=== Mandatory Access Control

* objects/subjects are partitioned into classes
* they are grouped by (partial order ??):
** object importance relative to 1/2 parts of CIA
** subject trustworthiness
* rights are granted based on some property related to object/subject level
** if object order is comparable then the operation may or may not be invoked
** if not comparable cant do shit 
* there is someone who has a final say
** if the policy defines a hard cutoff owner cant do shit

== MAC Information Flow

=== MAC Information Flow 1

* Typically used for confidentiality
* Class indicates how secret the information is
** The higher object is in the class -> the more important it is to keep reserved
** If subject is high in the class -> more trustworthy
* *TRUSTWORTHINESS IS KING*

* If object = file:
** Operations = {read/write/append}
** read (non destructive): see
** write (potentially destructive): modify
** append (non destructive): update
* A subject in class C may be entitled to:
** read any file with `class < = C`
** Write any file with `class == C`
** Append a record to a file to a `class > C`
** *Only within its own class*
** Secret 1 can operate on Reserved 1/Confidential 1
** To operate on class 2 they need to get to the top of the graph and move down 
*** e.g. a military base has a chief
*** chief has a secretary who books appointments and such
*** if we don't let secretary book appointments -> low levels can't communicate with high levels 
* This is done to avoid copying critical information to low security classes and then leaked (no write down)
* *Information must only flow uphill*

==== No write down

* Bell-Padula

* Prevents downhill information leak

* Protects confidentiality of information

* Information level at high levels increases (bad)
** the level of information cannot decrease
** updates cannot occur on low levels
*** e.g. general's secretary send email with appointment info -> email becomes general level which is a bit silly
** information is periodically declassified to reduce accumulation
** declassifiying the wrong information provides an excellent attack surface (Snowden)
*** they will try to get declassification rights to leak information

=== MAC Information Flow 2

* Typically used for Integrity

* Subject level determines reliaility -> i.e. does the correct things
** e.g. a program that does what we need correctly/an employee we trust to have his shit together
* *RELIABILITY IS KING*

* Object class indicates importance of the things within that object
** e.g. var/struct where we keep parameters for a medical device -> we want it to be correct else bad
*** the higher the level -> the more important the var/struct is for the system to work correctly

* A subject in class C can:
** Write any file with `class < = C`
** Read any file with `class  = > C`
*** we trust C -> C+1 is more trustworthy than C so we don't let C write to C+1's stuff
*** e.g. operator cant decide when to open the valve but he can read the temperature and do things

* MAC 1 and MAC 2 can't easily coexist
** need 2 levels for each object/subject
*** the owner of an object has to decide whether they value Integrity over Confidentialty or vice versa
*** what a given object can do varies depending on the owner's choices

==== No write up

* Biba

* Low integrity subjects can't update high integrity objects
* Integrity > confidentiality
* You can know certain info but you can't do anything with it unless explicitly allowed
** bank account password -> important to keep safe (confidentiality)
** nuclear power plant shutdown temperature is picked by someone who knows what they're doing -> doesn't matter if password is known it just needs to be value

=== Watermark

MAC policies are often dynamic:

* Subject S logs in (public level)
* S reads/writes info -> this info is public
* S accesses reserved 1 -> S can no longer write to public level files
* You can only increase your level
** Unless you log out and start over

== Policy and Regulation

* Hard to find pure DAC/MAC systems
* There are rules that constrain what system owners can do
** Privacy regulation (GDPR)
*** In the USA there is no right to protect personal information
*** e.g. EU -> I decide who knows my home address
*** USA -> if someone figures out where I live that information belongs to them
*** You have to prove that you need certain data before you can store and use it
** Pure DAC is thus impossible (owner doesn't have total freedom)
** The less info there is -> the less they can steal
* Critical infrastructure
** has to satisfy regulations on the robustness of the infrastructure to prevent intrustions
** Information on intrusions should be shared
* Financial entities
** have to satisfy regulations on resilience

=== Standards & Best Practices

There is a hierarchy:

. Laws and regulations
. Standards
* ISO 27001 defines who is and isn't secure (best effort)
. Best practices
* Sets of rules agreed upon by members of a particular sector
** kind of iffy best not to rely on them unless no other choice

== Trusted Computing Base

* TCB includes any modules involved in enforcing the security policy
* Not interested in functional errors, only security
** Unless functional errors lead to security problems
* TCB modules are highly critical
** any bug could be (and almost always is) a vulnerability
* Systems need to trust all TCB components

=== TCB size

* System security is inversely proportional to TCB size
** odds of errors/mistakes are lower
** odds of exploitation are lower
** KISS principle
* you need to know how the TCB works otherwise what are you doing
