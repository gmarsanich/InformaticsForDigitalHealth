== Network vs Host vs Log

3 ways to check intrusions

. Host operations
. Network traffic
. Logs

The first 2 are real time*

Log analysis is periodic

* always a posteriori
* information is saved so they can do more sophisticated analysis

== Signature Based Detection

Known attacks are often *signed*

* a specific sequence of actions define an attack signature
* only if someone realizes that those actions are part of an attack
* signature can be uploaded to databases or shared or whatever
* if I see actions on my system that match a known attack signature there's a good chance that I'm under attack
* can also be a hashed program

Can't use for new attacks

Default allow

* anything not in the signature db is allowed
* weak to 0-days because unknown

3 types:

* Dynamic
** Run the program in sandbox and compare its actions to db
* Static
** check the code and match against signature
** done by old antivirus software
* Hybrid
** does both

=== Input Events for Signatures

Endpoint events

* OS invocation
* Memory analysis
* Downloaded files
* Executed programs

Network events

* contents of transmitted packets
* URL being called

Signature based network intrusion detection requires network traffic monitoring

* tools built around packet sniffers (WireShark?)
* sniffers *cannot*:
** route traffic
** slow down traffic
* this can be exploited by attackers
** run DOS to slow down traffic
** send malicious packets during DOS

=== Worm signature

//from slides

if HTML file has this particular sequence of GET calls then it's a worm

=== Use cases?

. Known-Known
* known variant of known malware
* exact match
. Known-Unknown
* unknown variant of known malware
* use regex for partial matches
. Unknown-Unknown
* good luck

The number of false positives increases as we move through the use cases (it's already very high)

Known-Known has low(ish) number of false positives but high false negatives

=== Solutions to high cost

. Aggregation
* collect multiple warnings before sending alert
. Correlation
* Correlate events
** anomalies X and Y happened within 10ms of each other
** ip address I made 10,000 requests a second
* assign priorities


== Anomaly Based

A posteriori way of finding attacks independently of how it happened

Discover anomalies through statistics

* define normal behavior through observation/learning
** e.g. invoked services, login time and session duration, user requests, network bandwidth
* build statistical model of system behavior
* find abnormal behavior
** have to avoid false positives
** but also false negatives
* have to update parameters regularly
** user behavior changes often

If you get attacked during learning period then it's basically useless

3 ways of doing it:

. Dynamic
* running program and observing behavior
. Static
* static analysis of program behavior (like compilers do)
. Hybrid
* do a bit of both

=== Specification-based

Sometimes normalcy comes from application specs

* app should behave a certain way
* if app behaves differently then likely an anomaly
* e.g. app reads from database but doesn't write to it
* if app starts writing then anomaly

=== NIDES

Early anomaly/intrusion detection system (1989)

Looked at UNIX terminal commands (grep, emacs, finger, gawk, etc.)

Each command had a number of days required for learning user behavior

* e.g. emacs had 84 days of learning time (lmao??)

== Polymorphism and obfuscation

Attackers worry about countermeasures so they try to counter the countermeasures

Multiple versions of the same malware so that signature matching breaks

How? *Obfuscation*

Many types of obfuscation

* Encryption based/polymorphism
** encrypt malicious code
* Lexical transformations
** modify variable names
* Control transofmations
** change program flow and preserve semantics
* Data transformations
** modify data structures
* Anti disassembly
** can't easily decompile and analyze
* Anti debugging
** can't easily investigate flow using debugging tools

=== Encryption based

Encrypt malware with a different key each time

Malware files have both malware code and decryptor code

Matching the malware itself doesn't work but you can still match the decryptor signature

* decryptor code doesn't change

Attackers can encrypt the malware multiple times to encrypt the decryptor and the malware together

* this process can be repeated as many times as the attacker wants

=== Abusing ZIP

Concatenate multiple zip files into one

One of these zip files has malware inside it

The malware is now spread out throughout the file so gl with finding it

=== EMOTET

Was active for 10 years (!!) despite known signatures

How does it work (generally)?

. User receives spam emails with malicious links/files/whatever
. User is given reason to open file/click link
. For Word/Excel files the file executes VBA macros (Microsoft moment)
. Downloads powershell and starts shell that downloads and runs malware payload
* ransomware, trojan, bitcoin miner, whatever

New EMOTET version (2022)

* uses Microsoft HTML Application (mshta.exe) files
* Uses signed Microsoft software to execute malicious code
** this is a *confused deputy attack*
* mshta is used to execute a malicious HTA file
** these HTA files appear to be empty because they are obfuscated

=== LOCKBIT 3.0

Malware as a service provider that encrypts its executable wit the client's password

* no password -> can't use malware

It's region locked (lmao???)

=== Zmist (old as shit)

Extreme anti signature countermeasures

Hid bits and pieces of virus code by spreading it out into host application

.Zmist algorithm kinda
[source,python]

legit_func_1()

legit_func_2()

malware_func_1()

legit_func_3()

----

In reality this happens at assembly level but i cba writing that

Starting point of malware code is set at random to be even more cancer inducing

== Defeating sandboxes

A sandbox is a protected environment to download and execute unknown code (VM, container? VM better)

Isolated from the main system

Monitor sandbox actions for anomalies

Smart malware can figure out it's in a VM and hide its malicious behavior or even escape (only if particularly smart)

VMM/Hypervisor:

* allocates/multiplexes physical resources to VMs
* Virtual Machine Monitor wants OS before hardware
* Hypervisor is the OS

=== VM implementation strategies

. Trap and emulate
* very old implementation (IBM 360)
* execute guest OS in unprivileged state
* host doesn't allow access to protected resources
. Para virtualization
* call VMM when guest can't do certain things without generating exception
* requires guest OS modification
* good performance
. Interpretative Execution
* Any time guest OS performs an action the host OS actually does it
. Binary Translation
* Take application code and translate to binary
* Add calls to guest OS or VMM as needed
* Dynamic translation layer takes care of the whole thing
* VMware does this
* Performance not so good

=== Virtualizable CPU

x86 is not virtualizable so implementing para virtualization and interpretation can't easily be used

* x86 is CISC (*complex instruction set*)
* RISC CPUs are easily virtualizable

=== VM Detection

VMs often have specific tools/software (clipboard integration, drag and drop file sharing, memory ballooning)

* Detecting these is a dead giveaway that you're in a VM

Shared memory is used to simplify VM/VMM communication

* Can also be detected

Clean VMs are very easy to detect

* normal user PCs have a billion things running and 81427 things installed
* if PC only has default apps running and nothing else then good indication that you're in a VM

About a million other things malware designers can do to discover VMs

=== WannaCry

Worm ransomware that encrypted boot block (MBR encrypted=cant do shit)

Tried to contact some non existent website

* if fail: physical hardware -> bingo
* if found: Sandbox -> die
** sandbox says yes to find what else this funny software did

Researchers created that website to trick malware into always killing itself

Unfortunately malware designers wrote a different version that checked a different website
