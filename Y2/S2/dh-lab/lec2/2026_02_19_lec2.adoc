== Terminology + brief history

=== System

Set of integrated+interacting components

Typically defined limits

* this thing is in the system
* that thing is not in the system

Systems can be hierarchical

* a system can be a component of another system

Many types of systems:

. complex (linear)
* systems whose behavior cannot be determined/inferred from the behaviors of its components
* interactions between components generate complexity

. dynamical
* systems where fixed rules define time dependencies
** geometrical space
* i.e. systems that change over time

=== Digital Health

Complex interaction of different industries and stakeholders

* in this case interaction between computer science/AI/IT/data processing and healthcare

== Ideal pipeline for working with large biomedical data

=== 1. Knowledge extraction

Read literature

Acquire data

Acquire information from data

=== 2. Data integration

Integrate data from sources

* build dataset
* clean dataset

=== 3. Biomarker identification

Identify some kind of marker of a disease/condition

* people with MS have overactivation of some gene
* people with hemiplegia have asymmetric accelerometer signals

=== 4. Pathway analysis

Zoom into subset of biomarker information

* find subnetwork

=== 5. Modeling and simulation

Perturb the network to understand how it changes

* what happens when I increase dosage by x units?
* what happens if I increase the dosage from 2x a week to 3x a week?

Need to tune the network elements

* concentrations
* etc

Simulations are stochastic

* need to account for Brownian motion of molecules
