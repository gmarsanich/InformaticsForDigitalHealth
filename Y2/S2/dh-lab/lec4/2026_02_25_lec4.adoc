== Biomarker identification

Identifying a limited number of variables to distinguish populations or subgroups

* clinical
* molecular

These are not necessarily causes of diseases/conditions

* can be consequences of conditions

Many techniques depending on domain

For example:

=== Differential Expression Analysis

Used for molecular components in biology

Check if variables change over time or after treatment

Statistical tools:

. log fold change
* use threshold to make results more robust 
** keep results if stem:[ |LF_i| \gt \text{threshold} ]
* not robust to noise
* not robust to normal variation
* no indication of statistical significance

. Hypothesis testing
* T-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
** take sample at time 0
** give treatment
** run stat test to check difference at time N
* Classic significance correction techniques
** Benjamin-Hochberg
** Bonferroni

=== Technology

Depends on domain/task

. Transcriptomics
* quantitative PCR
** low noise
** low number
** low cost
* microarray
** high noise
** high number
** high cost
* RNAseq
** medium noise
** high number
** very high cost

. Proteomics
* more expensive than transcriptomics
* very noisy
* often not worth it

. Metabolomics
* same here
