== Cyberphysical systems

Systems that exist in 2 worlds:

. virtual
* processing
* communication
. physical
* sensors
* actuators

Physical part brings information to virtual world

* smartphone touch screen is actuator

== Smart environments

Environment where smart objects live

* smart objects are necesarily physical and/or cyber objects
* i.e. cyberphysical objects

They are subjected to physical experiences/constraints

* damage
* theft
* tampering

Need to design them with these in mind

=== Cyberphysical system design

Take into account environment conditions

. Free placement
* size
* material
* material properties
* weight

. Mobility
* wires/wireless
* batteries/wall outlet
* position awareness
** GPS
** using WiFi displacement

. Physical exposure
* redundancy
** fault tolerant
** robust
* security
** encryption
** physical security
* cost
** cheaper -> less valuable for thieves
** cheaper -> less damaging if lost/broken

=== What does smart even mean?

No real definition

* depends on characteristics

Typically related to human interaction

* seamless
* unobtrusive
** smart parts of environment are blended in
** shouldn't feel like interacting with a machine

Objects/environments that are reactive to the user's actions

* also not necessarily relative to users
* can be other systems
** e.g. multiple thermostats that communicate to their respective controllers
** if one breaks then pairing is lost (really?)
*** we could say that this is not smart because it requires some expertise to set up the system

=== What is a sensor?

*Transducer* would be a better term

* sensors are used to mean the entire device
* in reality a sensor uses a transducer

A device/tool/something that:

. intercepts a signal
. transforms the physical signal into and analog signal
. transforms the analog signal to digital using ADC
. processes digital signal
. converts processed into analog
. sends to next step through radio (if wireless)

=== What is an actuator?

Similar to a sensor

* converts a digital signal to a phyisical reaction

== What is IoT?

Last evolution of internet infrastructure

. IT
* Information technology
* for nerds by nerds
. OT
* operational technology
* industry, healthcare
. PT
* personal technology
* PCs, phones
. Sensors
* IoT kind of

Independent/autonomous devices that interact with each other and possibly with humans

* specific characteristics depend on use case
** wired/wireless
** wearable
** etc.

Can be cheap/low power devices (essentially refurbished old tech)

* Arduino
* RPi

Or higher power devices

* HD surveillance camera
** Image processing
* Motion sensors

ITU-T definition takes into account Internet and Things

* mostly focuses on Internet

== IoT Architecture

Internet uses layers and interfaces to manage complexity

* networking layer
* operational layer
* whatever

IoT layers are not as well defined/agreed upon as the normal internet layers

There are general categories:

. Perception
* physical objects
* sensors

. Communication
* i.e. the entire internet + all its layers

. Device/resource/service management
* device discovery and management
** zeroconf
** discoverability
** interactions
* services

. Data and knowledge management
* data processing etc.

Security should be a continuous strip that goes through all layers

=== Networking

We moved from IPv4 to IPv6 (did we? subnetting and NAT exists)

Using IPv6 we can connect:

* 655,571 billions of billions of devices
* per square meter of the *entire* surface of the Earth

But why?

* no real answer
* there are more devices on the internet than people on earth
* the number of mobile devices grows exponentially
** in 2014 there were already more mobile devices than people on earth

We unknowingly (kind of) intreact with more computers than we can see

* PC
* WiFi access points
* routers
* cloud servers
** reverse proxies
** load balancers
** content delivery networks

Humans cannot control all these computers manually

* they have to interact with each other
* they are effectively sensors
** load balancers see that the load on a node of a distributed system is too hight and it reacts accordingly

=== IoT databases

Classical relational databases don't work well for IoT

* predefined database structures are fast but not flexible
* if you get a new sensor the data might change in some way
** the data in the database might be different

NoSQL databases are used more often

* PostGres
* InfluxDB
* MongoDB

Less performant and more flexible

==== MongoDB

MongoDB uses documents instead of fields

* each document is like a JSON structure
* fields in the documents may be arrays

These documents correspond to general programming data structures

* arrays
* tuples
* etc.

A relation is represented as a collection of documents

* the documents don't need to have the same structure

== IoT and the cloud

Sensors/actuators are at the edge

The biggest players provide data/knowledge management

* Azure
* Google cloud
* Amazon Web Services

=== IoT platforms

Services that 

* deploy
* run
. manage
* identification
** IP address assignment
** MAC address
** device information

IoT solutions

The usual suspects own these (to no-one's suprise)

==== Device/resource management

. identification
* hostname, IP, function advertising
. Discovery
* advertising again
. Device management
. Service composition
* integrating between simple services
* building complex services from simple services
