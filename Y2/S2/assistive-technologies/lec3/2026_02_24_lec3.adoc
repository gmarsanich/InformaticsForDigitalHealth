== Overview of computer aids

Many ways/tools/techniques to use computers with visual impairments

* screen readers
* magnifiers
* audio feedback

Tools for most OSs

* Windows
* MacOS
* Linux/BSD

== Using the computer with visual impairments

It's definitely possible with the right help

=== Software aids

Various types of software aids

. screen readers
* blind users
. magnifiers
* low vision users

These work best when software is designed with accessibility in mind

* accessible versions
** high contrast versions
** reader friendly versions
*** hierarchical page structures to figure out where you are
* APIs that interact with AT
** telling SRs what is/isn't important
** telling SRs what is/isn't interactive

Software magnifiers include:

. Supernova (Windows, commercial)
* high res zoom
* contrast modes
* TTS
* interaction hints
** bright boxes around selected elements

Zooming is not enough by itself

* complementary features are more important
** adjustable contrast
*** black on white vs white/yellow on black

Some of these can be implemented straight into applications/websites

* changing colors
* zooming
* changing font
** family
** size
** weight

Reading long text can be straining even with magnifiers and contrast adjustments

* screen readers exist

Screen readers include:

. JAWS SR (Windows, commercial)
* advanced screen reader
** has a lot of features and commands

. NVDA (Windows, FOSS)
* modular
** has add-ons
* made in Python
* good for reading documents and websites
* too simple for complex interfaces like Microsoft Office/Teams (Microsoft moment)
Most TTS have really bad voices

* doesn't really matter but would be nice
* accuracy and features are more important
** read line by line/word by word/etc.
** information about images would also be good
** active/focused window information using voice commands/keyboard shortcuts
** active/focused window element should be readable too

=== Hardware aids

Hardware aids also exist:

. special braille keyboards
. braille displays
* converts text to braille code

These typically work on top of screen readers

Hardware tools can be used to perceive the real world as well

. Explore 8 magnifier
* magnifier
* adjustable contrast
* near/far viewing modes
* can take pictures and zoom/pan
* multiple cameras
** front
** straight down

== Mobile devices

=== Mobile screen readers

Magnifiers also exist for mobile devices

* smartphones
* tablets

Can't use keyboard shortcuts on touch screen only devices

* use gestures instead

== Other assistive technologies

Braille printers
