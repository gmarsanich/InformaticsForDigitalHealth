== What is NLP?

Subfield of AI and linguistics

* uses computers to analyze linguistic material
* mostly linked to linguistics
** can be applied to written text
** also spoken word

Enables mathematical reasoning on nautral language

== Language processing levels

=== Phonetics/phonology

Most basic level

* sound has meaning
** not always but mostly
* sequence of sounds represented by an alphabet
** assuming we have an alhabet and not ideograms
* so simple that old computers could generate correct sounding gibberish
* used for:
** speech to text
** text to speech

Typical problem is matching when something starts and something ends

Health application:

* recognize which words become less controlled in people with Parkinson's

=== Morphology

Deals with the forms of words

* literally how words are formed
** suffixes, affixes, desinations, cases, etc.
* lemmas
** the bit that has meaning
** bits that have meaning on their own (so not LLM tokens)
* stems
** stuff you staple onto lemmas to affect the meaning

Health application:

* codifying medical terms into standard codes

=== Syntax

Studies sentence structure/grammar

* requires grammar
** set of rules that generates a language

Used for dependency parsing

* which words are/aren't linked
** dead end problem
** solved by LLMs and GPTs and such
* tackles hierarchical problem of language
** language is hierarchical
** represented linearly
*** one word/lemma always comes after another

Health application:

* relation extraction in medication-dosage documents
** administer [amt][unit] of [drg] to patient [pz]

=== Semantics

Studies literal meaning of language

* maps linguistic expression to denotations in a knowledge base and such
** need to find a function that does this
* used for word sense disambiguation
** e.g. fish as a noun vs fish as a verb


Health application:

* entity linking and disambiguation
** "I feel cold" -> temperature
** "I have a cold" -> illness

=== Pragmatics

Studies language in context

* what happens in real language
* i.e. contextual intent
** we don't always communicate literally
** i.e. metaphors, allegories, similes, etc.

Also deals with who/what/when/why

Health application:

* health chatbots
** Meaning changes with context
** "Shortness of breath" 
*** could be temporarily out of breath from running to the bus stop
*** could be having a heart attack

== History of NLP

NLP is an old field (1950s and earlier - now)

=== Symbolic wave (1950s - 1990s)

Handcrafted set of rules to formalize language

* this is valid [language]
* this is not valid [language]
* basically formal logic
** TFL/FOL

You can combine words from different sets and produce language

* only in specific ways

Deterministic system

* big if else chain
** good for programming
** bad for natural language

Brittle system

* any time a new word is codified the system breaks

Shallow system

* doesn't understand meaning
* only manipulates strings

=== Statistical wave (1990s - 2010s)

Uses HMMs and probability

* predict next word/letter/character given the previous word/letter/character

=== Neural (2010s - now)

Based on deep learning

* dense representations
** vector embeddings
** language highlights points in a space

Uses attention to determine importance
