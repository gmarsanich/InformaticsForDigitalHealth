== Why so many variants?

Real biological networks are more complex than what can be represented by abstract boolean networks

* real genes aren't only active/inactive
* gene regulation changes with the context
* genes aren't always expressed exactly the same way
* gene activation is continuous and dose dependent
* regulators act with different timings

== Threshold boolean networks

Simplify update definition

Use weights and thresholds for interactions

* often exact boolean formulas are unknown
* weighted sums make modeling simpler

There is a set of input weights that describe the strength and sign of the influence

* if weighted sum > threshold -> become active

Some genes can self activate

* if the weighted sum == 0 -> become active
* otherwise inactive

=== Why threshold networks?

More specific than vanilla boolean networks

More expressive than vanilla boolean networks

* more usable as well

* in principle threshold networks can be implemented with complex vanilla boolean networks

Robust to perturbations

* arrives to the same attractor regardless of perturbation*

== Multi state/state networks

Not very common but good to know about

Genes can have multiple states

* define expression levels
* each gene can have its own expression levels

More compact and natural than vanilla boolean networks

* fewer variables required to express the same number of states

Update rules use thresholds

== Probabilistic boolean networks

Updates are associated with probability distributions

* models stochasticity of cell events
* genes may have multiple update functions
** each update function will have an associated probability

At each time step a function is selected according to their associated probability

* the selected functions are used to compute the next step
* the network becomes a Markov chain over the state space stem:[\{0, 1\}^n]

More compact than vanilla boolean networks

* a single PBN can represent multiple vanilla boolean networks

== Fuzzy boolean networks

Not very common in bioinformatics

* more common in human relations and geopolitics

The activation of a gene is any real number between 0 and 1

* not necessarily discrete

Logical operators are replaced with fuzzy operators

* operators that approximate logical operators
* AND is replaced with min
** AND(1, 1) = 1; AND(1, 0) = 0
* OR is replaced with max
* NOT is replaced with 1 - 

The update rule takes in a fuzzy combination of inputs and an activation function

* activation function may be nonlinear

Attractors become fixed points in the space

== Reaction Systems

Abstract rules that define GRNs

. Turn all boolean formulas into disjunctive normal form
. Write a reaction for each disjunct
. Prune irrelevant information from the execution trace
* tells us which genes contributed to the final state -> which genes contributed to the activation of gene F
** the state of gene A is irrelevant to the final state
