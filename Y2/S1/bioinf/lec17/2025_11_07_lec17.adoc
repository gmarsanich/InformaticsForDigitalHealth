== Biological Networks

3 relatively abstract ways of representing networks

. Gene regulatory networks
* nodes are genes
* edges are influences

. Cell pathways
* interactions between molecules
* the chemical reactions involved

. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPI)
* nodes are proteins
* edge between interacting proteins

== What is a pathway?

Pathways are collections of chemical reactions

* sequence of reactions

Each reaction transforms *reactants* into *products*

* reaction within a pathway often share something
** reactant(s)
** product(s)

Interactions create a network structure

== Cell Pathways

Cell pathways are *Chemical Reaction Networks* (CRN) describing specific processes happening inside cells

=== Glycolisis

Transformation of 1 glucose into 2 pyruvate

Metabolic pathway

* first step in cellular respiration

Glycolis is mostly linear

* sequence of transformations

=== EGF Signaling Pathways

EGF =  epidermial growth factor

Signaling pathways use receptors that capture signals

* when protein binds to its receptor it stimulates something
* in this case the growth of something

Dysregulation in this pathway can often result in *cancer*

== Modeling CRNs

Using mathematical models of these reactions we can implement algorithms to simulate them

.Definitions
* chemical reactions *transform* molecules
** reactants are transformed into products
* Molecules are represented with symbols
* Assume molecules float in some fluid
** water
** cytoplasm
** some other fluid(s)
* quantity is expresed in concentration/density
** not 317236871 A molecules
** 15 mols per liter (stem:[\frac{\text{mols}}{\text{l}}]) of A molecules
** stem:[[A\]] denotes the concentration
* there can be multiple instances of each molecule in a given reaction
** denoted with coefficient stem:[l] or stem:[l']
** called *stoichiometric coefficients*
* the *kinetic constant* stem:[k] is a parameter used to compute the frequency of reaction
** how many times the reaction takes place in the solution
** stem:[k \simeq \text{rate of reaction}]
** stem:[k_{-1}] represents the kinetic constant of the reverse of the reaction
* the rate of reaction stem:[r = k \cdot \text{concentration of the reactant(s)}]

=== Types of chemical reactions

WARNING: slides

=== Mass action kinetics

Assuming the solution is well mixed

* molecules aren't localized in any particular spot
* they can move freely
** can meet more freely

Meeting molecules *may or may not* react

* the more reactants there are -> the more often the reaction takes place
** rate of reaction increases with reactant presence
** k * product of concentration

The unit of measurement of the rate of reaction depends on the number of reactants

=== Dynamic Equilibrium

A reversible reaction is in dynamic equilibrium when both directions have the same rate

Reactions at equilibrium look static

* in reality reactions are happening constantly
* reactions in opposite directions compensate each other

=== Reactions -> Ordinary Differential Equations

ODEs are just equations with derivatives

* e.g. reactions over time -> rate of reaction
** positive derivative -> var is increasing
** negative derivative -> var is decreasing

Each individual sub reaction in a larger reaction produces its own ODE

Numerically integrating the ODEs returns the reaction dynamics
