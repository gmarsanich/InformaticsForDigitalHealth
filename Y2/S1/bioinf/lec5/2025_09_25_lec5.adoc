== Introduction and Graphical Representation

Computational chemistry exploits computer science to solve chemical problems

* predict chemical behaviors
* estimate structures and behaviors of molecules
* predict catalyitic reactions

Focus on ligand design rather than drug design

.Ligands
*ligands* are small molecules that can somehow interact with some receptor somewhere

.Drugs
*drugs* are commercial molecules that can contain ligands

* they need to be optimized
* they need to pass clinical trials
* they also need to go through ethics committees

.Receptor
biological structure to which specific signaling molecules can bind to 

these molecules can be:

* peptides
* neurotransmitters
* hormones
* pharmaceutical drugs
* toxins
* and many more

=== Induced Fit Model

Ligands and receptors are not rigid

They can adapt somewhat to fit each other

* the receptor can only really modify the binding site

== Molecular Modeling

In the 70s they were represented as 2D topological structures

* still used in organic chemistry
* halogens aren't drawn because they are implied
* carbon is also usually not drawn

Real molecules exist in 3D space 

* deducing 3D structures from 2D representations is very difficult
* you need to know the reciprocal space between the atoms
* need to know the spatial disposition

Specific colors are used in 3D models to denote different atoms and bonds

* *CPK* color scheme
* Oxygen = red
* Hydrogen = white
* Carbon = gray usually
* Nitrogen = blue

=== 3D representation

4 main ways

.Line/Wireframe
* Use lines to draw the molecule
* bonds and atoms are mostly indistinguishable 

.Stick
* Atom-atom bonds are like tubes (thicker lines)
* most used representation

.Ball and stick
* Use ball to represent the nucleus of the atoms
* Bonds are represented as tubes

.CPK
* space filling representation
* each atom is given the van der Wallis radius of the real atoms
* the bigger then radius -> the bigger the atom

=== Amino acids to proteins

Amino group + carboxylic acid group -> amino acid

Amino acids bond from N-term to C-term

This is a *peptide bond*

* which is an ammide group
** carbon+oxygen+nitrogen
* peptide bonds release water
** OH and H are lost -> forms H2O
* peptide bonds behave like a double bond
** no free rotation around the peptide bond
** they can move if they have a good reason
** they tend to be parallel -> bd , or reverse -> dp
* generally the bulky groups are oriented in opposite directions (dp)

The *alpha* carbon is the carbon atom that connects the amino group and the carboxylic group

They are used to represent each amino acid

* we can draw a connection between 2 alpha carbons to represent the whole protein

The angles between amino acids are called *phi* and *psi*

* the most common angles are 100 to 180 and ~ -60 +/- 10 degrees
* beta strands mostly 100-180
* right helix mostly ~-60
* left helix very rare but mostly medium positive angles

== X ray resolution

3D picture of a macromolecule

Resolution is the sharpness of the image

* lower is better
** if res=15cm you can discriminate objects of size ~15cm
** if res=2cm you can discriminate objects in the range of ~2cm

You don't need extreme resolutions

* use enough resolution for the task
