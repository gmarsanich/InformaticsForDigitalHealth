== Introduction and Graphical Representation

Computational chemistry exploits computer science to solve chemical problems

* predict chemical behaviors
* estimate structures and behaviors of molecules
* predict catalytic reactions

Focus on *ligand* design rather than drug design

.Receptor
biological structure to which specific signaling molecules can bind to

these molecules can be:

* peptides
* neurotransmitters
* hormones
* pharmaceutical drugs
* toxins
* and many more

.Ligands
*ligands* are small molecules that can somehow interact with some receptor somewhere

.Drugs
*drugs* are commercial molecules that can contain ligands

* they need to be optimized
* they need to pass clinical trials
* they also need to go through ethics committees

=== Induced Fit Model

Ligands and receptors are not rigid

They can adapt somewhat to fit each other

* the receptor can only really modify the binding site

The geometry of the binding site changes depending on conformational changes induced by the bound ligand

* if a ligand doesn't quite fit into the binding site the binding site can adapt itself to allow the ligand to fit

== Molecular Modeling

In the 70s they were represented as 2D topological structures

* still used in organic chemistry
* halogens aren't drawn because they are implied
* carbon is also usually not drawn

Real molecules exist in 3D space

* deducing 3D structures from 2D representations is very difficult
* you need to know the reciprocal space between the atoms
* need to know the spatial disposition

Specific colors are used in 3D models to denote different atoms and bonds

* *CPK* color scheme
* Oxygen = red
* Hydrogen = white
* Carbon = gray usually
* Nitrogen = blue

=== 3D representation

4 main ways

.Line/Wireframe
* Use lines to draw the molecule
* bonds and atoms are mostly indistinguishable

.Stick
* Atom-atom bonds are like tubes (thicker lines)
* most used representation

.Ball and stick
* Use ball to represent the nucleus of the atoms
* Bonds are represented as tubes

.CPK
* space filling representation
* each atom is given the van der Waals radius of the real atoms
* the bigger then radius -> the bigger the atom

== Amino acids to proteins

Amino group + carboxylic acid group -> amino acid

Amino acids bond from N-term to C-term

This is a *peptide bond*

* which is an ammide group
** carbon+oxygen+nitrogen
* peptide bonds release water
** OH and H are lost -> forms H2O
* peptide bonds behave like a double bond
** no free rotation around the peptide bond
** they can move if they have a good reason
** they tend to be parallel -> bd, or reverse -> dp
* generally the bulky groups are oriented in opposite directions (dp)

The *alpha* carbon is the carbon atom that connects the amino group and the carboxylic group

They are used to represent each amino acid

* we can draw a connection between 2 alpha carbons to represent the whole protein
** called the stem:[C\alpha] *trace*
** the result will be the protein's skeleton
** simplified view
** ignores all other molecules/atoms present

The angles between amino acids in a protein are called *phi* (stem:[\phi]) and *psi* (stem:[\psi])

* stem:[\phi] is the angle between the alpha carbon and the left backbone item
** i.e. stem:[\phi]--stem:[C\alpha]--<rest of the molecule>

* stem:[\psi] is the angle between the alpha carbon and the right backbone item
** i.e. <rest of the molecule>--stem:[C\alpha]--stem:[\psi]

The most common angles are:

* between 100 and 180 degrees
** beta strands mostly (100, 180)
* ~ -60 +/- 10 degrees
** right helix mostly ~-60
* left helix very rare but mostly medium positive angles

=== Protein representation

Proteins can be represented as *ribbons* to visualize their secondary structure

.1. stem:[\alpha]-helices
Most common secondary structure

Most stable secondary structure

* high number of internal bonds keep the shape steady

Right-handed coil

Every backbone N-H group donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone C=O group 4 residues earlier

* `i+4 -> t`

.2. stem:[\beta]-sheets
Laterally connected beta strands

* needs at least 2 backbone H bonds
* formed into twisted pleated sheet
* generally between 3 and 10 amino acids long

Mostly found near other strands

* they form large H bond networks
* the N-H bonds in one strand bond with the C=O groups in one of the adjacent strands

.3 .stem:[\beta]-turns
Non regular secondary structure

Most common *turn* type

* molecule that causes change in direction of the polypeptide chain

== Protein representation formats

Many ways of representing protein composition

=== PDB Format

Row based text file containing atomic coordinates

* rows are called *records*
* fixed width
** known number of columns

Columns include:

* type
** atom
** heteroatom
*** atom that isn't part of the protein
* atom number
** order in which the atom is seen
* atom name
** chemical symbol
*** C, O, Mg, Na, H, etc.
* XYZ coordinates
** where each object is in space
* Occupancy
** estimation of the amount of each conformation observed in the crystal
* B-factor
** represents the amount of motion of an atom within the protein
** lower -> not much movement, atom is in the same position in every molecule
** higher -> lots of movement, atom is in a different position in every molecule

=== MOL2 Format

Section based

Each section has multiple lines

.1. `@<TRIPOS>MOLECULE`
. general information about the molecule
.. name/human readable comment(s)
. number of entries in the next sections
. molecule class
.. single molecule
.. protein
. types of charges

.2. `@<TRIPOS>ATOM`
. atom information
. atom number of each atom in the file
. chemical name
. XYZ coordinates (Angstrom)
. Mol2 atom type
.. additional information
.. formal charge
.. hybridization
. residue number
. residue name
. atomic charge(s)

.3. `@<TRIPOS>BOND`
. Bond number
. 1st atom participating in bond
. 2nd atom participating in bond
. bond order
* can be either `1, 2, 3, ar`
** `ar` indicates *aromatic*

== X ray resolution

3D picture of a macromolecule

Resolution is the sharpness of the image

* lower is better
** if res=15cm you can discriminate objects of size ~15cm
** if res=2cm you can discriminate objects in the range of ~2cm

You don't need extreme resolutions

* use enough resolution for the task
