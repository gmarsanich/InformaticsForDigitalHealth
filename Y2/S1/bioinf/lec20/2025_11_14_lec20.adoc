== What are non-mass action models?

Models with more complex functions than number of reactant * reactant

* stem:[kx] no longer applies

== Michaelis-Menten kinetics

Describes irreversible enzyme catalyzed reactions

makes 2 assumptions:

* the whole reaction is irreversible
* the left side of the reactions are faster than the right
** enzyme concentrations are assumed to be at equilibrium

Generally it groups constants together and rewrites the reaction in terms of P that depends on Vmax (maximum rate of production)

* stem:[V_{max}] => enzyme concentration * enzyme reaction rate (stem:[k_2])

stem:[V_{max}] is also easy to compute/estimate in the lab

* measure the concentration of stem:[S] after stem:[n] seconds and plot
* the asymptote is == stem:[V_{max}] because we hit the maximum number of enzymes
* stem:[\frac{V_{max}} {2} = K_m] (the substrate concentration)

== Hill Kinetics

Generalization of MM kinetics

* additional term stem:[h] used as an exponent (Hill coefficient)
** represents *binding cooperativity*
*** *binding cooperativity* is a value that represents how much faster subsequent bindings happen
*** affects reaction rate over time
** stem:[h \gt 1] => more cooperative => accelerates
** stem:[h \lt 1] => less cooperative => decelerates
** stem:[h = 1] => no effect => does nothing
** reaction curve still has asymptote at stem:[V_{max}]
** shape of the curve changes

== Logistic Function

Comes from ecology

* environment with a population
* environment provides resources for stem:[k] individuals
** if pop < stem:[k] => pop grows
** if pop > stem:[k] => pop shrinks
** pop will eventually stabilize around stem:[k]

== SBLM

Markup language for systems biology

Subset of XML

* model tag -> names model
* supports multiple reactions
** lists them in a block
* supports multiple species
** lists them in a block
* multiple products
* multiple reactants
* specific kinetic law(s)
