== Pathway Databases

3 main pathway databases:

* https://genome.jp/kegg[KEGG] (Descriptive)
** represents reactions as graphs
** reactants are nodes
** reactions are edges
** some molecules influence reactions without being consumed

== Sensitivity Analysis

Given a function stem:[f(x, y, z)]

* how much does each parameter influence the result?

This is very important

* finds critical reactions
* assesses robustness
* finds critical parameters for experiments
** test only the most important parameters to save time

Typically parameters represent 2 things:

. reaction rate constants
. initial molecule concentration
* not as important in biology because processes are happening constantly
** still useful to know in other applications

stem:[S_i] increases as the strength of stem:[p_i] grows

2 types of sensitivity analysis:

=== Local SA

Measures the effect of single parameters on the output

* if I increase stem:[p_i] by 1% how much does stem:[X_t] change?
* numerically or analytically
** through partial derivatives

Most useful when:

* the model is ~linear near default parameters
* you need quick insight
* you trust your parameter estimates
** you're sure your estimates are decent enough

=== Global SA

Explores the entire parameter space

* requires sampling and variance based models

Many methods for global SA

* typically you want to reduce the number of combinations to reduce computational cost

Most useful when:

* parameters are uncertain or cover large ranges
** stem:[X] is between 10 and 10,000,000,000
* the model is nonlinear
* the model exhibits thresholds/switches
* you suspect parameter interactions
** stem:[f(x, y): \rightarrow x \cdot y]

==== Morris method

Usess the *Elementary Effect (EE)*

Tries random combinations of parameters

* picks a random parameter and computes the derivative
* compute for all random samples
* take the mean -> overall influence of parameter

Requires few simulations

Best used for:

* qualitative analysis/screening
* cheap to run
* detects interactions
** uses standard deviation of EE
* returns rank of parameter importance
* use when there are many uncertain parameters

==== Sobol Method

Decompose the total variance into contributions from each parameters and their interaction

* how much does each parameter+its interaction contribute to the variance of the model?

Returns first order effect

* effect of a single parameter on Variance

Also returns total effect

* effect of all group parameters

Best used for:

* quantitative/variance-based analysis
* expensive to run
* detects interactions
** uses stem:[S_{Ti}] indices
* returns fraction of output variance
** "these parameters account for 50% of output variance"
* use when you need precise analysis of a few parameters
** can be used to refine top Morris method output

== Knockout+mutation analysis

Studying how systems change w.r.p to structural/kinetic perturbations

* knockout: loss of gene
* mutation: partial loss/gain of some function

Used to predict effects of genetic mutations

Can be used to:

* predict effects of genetic mutations
** "if this gene mutates body hair becomes 1% longer"
* explore disease mechanisms
** "how does malaria cause its specific symptoms?"
* test pathway robustness hypotheses

=== Example: EGFR and cancer

EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a receptor that signals skin cell production

* often over-activated in cancer
* due to mutations
* leads to excessive phosphorylation of ERK

.Analysis plan:

. Simulate EGFR pathway
* normal EGFR activation

. Simulate *mutation*
* increase EGFR binding reaction constant by some amount (e.g. 3 times)

. Compare steady-state and dynamics of target proteins

We expect mutated EGFR to cause sustained high target proteins even with low EGF stimulus

* basically signals to produce tons of skin cells even its ligand isn't bound

We could *knock out* MEK (set it to 0)

* which should prevent ERK phosphorylation

Simply set stem:[k=0] for stem:[\text{MEK} \overset{k}{\rightarrow} \text{ERK}]

and compare with normal function

If this causes ERK to not be activated at all we can say that MEK is an essential node
