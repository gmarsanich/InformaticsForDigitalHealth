== Pathway Databases

3 main pathway databases:

* https://genome.jp/kegg[KEGG] (Descriptive)
** represents reactions as graphs
** reactants are nodes
** reactions are edges
** some molecules influence reactions without being consumed

== Sensitivity Analysis

Given a function stem:[f(x, y, z)]

* how much does each parameter influence the result?

This is very important

* finds critical reactions
* assesses robustness
* finds critical parameters for experiments
** test only the most important parameters to save time

Typically parameters represent 2 things:

. reaction rate constants
. initial molecule concentration
* not as important in biology because processes are happening constantly
** still useful to know in other applications

stem:[S_i] increases as the strength of stem:[p_i] grows

2 types of sensitivity analysis:

=== Local SA

Measures the effect of single parameters on the output

* if I increase stem:[p_i] by 1% how much does stem:[X_t] change?
* numerically or analytically
** through partial derivatives

=== Global SA

Explores the entire parameter space

* requires sampling and variance based models

Many methods for global SA

* typically you want to reduce the number of combinations to reduce computational cost

==== Morris method

Usess the *Elementary Effect (EE)*

Tries random combinations of parameters

* picks a random parameter and computes the derivative
* compute for all random samples
* take the mean -> overall influence of parameter

Requires few simulations

==== Sobol Method

Decompose the total variance into contributions from each parameters and their interaction

* how much does each parameter+its interaction contribute to the variance of the model?

Returns first order effect

* effect of a single parameter on Variance

Also returns total effect

* effect of all group parameters

== Knockout+mutation analysis

You can simulate models with structural/kinetic perturbations

* knockout: loss of gene
* mutation: partial loss/gain of some function

Used to predict effects of genetic mutations
