== What is Receptor Based Drug Design?

Create/identify new molecules that bind to specific receptors

Molecules are created/found based on the receptor's 3D structure and their complementary features

* e.g. receptor has 3 holes 3nm apart -> molecule will need 3 prongs 3nm apart

=== 3D receptor Data

Receptor structure is determined in a few ways

* x-ray crystallography
* NMR
* we saw it in earlier lectures

== Docking

Docking is an energy/geometry driven computational procedure that aims to identify the potential bioactive conformations of a molecule

2 types of docking

. Manual docking
* rarely done
* need binding hypothesis
* applicable to a few bonds

. Automatic docking
* The ligand is positioned automatically in the receptor
** pick the most energetically favorable conformation (lowest binding energy)

=== Automated Docking Algorithms

Needs 2 parts

. conformational modeling algorithm
* generates the conformations
* places conformation into receptor
. scoring function
* simplified force field equations
* assigns scores to each conformation
* lower score = best

When you have a combination of best fit and lowest energy then you win

* most energy efficient conformation
* should be bioactive conformation

==== Exhaustive algorithms

Exhaustive search algorithms

* most complete
* very time consuming

.F.R.E.D

* protein ligand docking program
* calculates binding energy of each possible ligand/receptor positions

==== Stochastic algorithms

Less exhaustive

* faster

=== Scoring Functions

Simplified force fields generally

* some are based on force fields

Equations used to calculate the binding energies of ligands and proteins

Takes into account multiple energetic components

* hydrophobic interactions
* hydrogen bonds
* electrostatic forces
** important for ligand/protein recognition
** H bonds are directional -> works if H bond donor is directed in a certain way towards the acceptor

=== Docking sofware

*DOCK* is a very common docking software

2 main parts

.Sphere gen

Describes the receptor shape as a bunch of spheres

Centers of spheres are considered potential locations for ligand atoms

.Grid

Evaluates the conformation

Given a molecule:

. define layers
. find center (anchor)
* looks for nice rigid structures (cycles, etc.)
* anchor is generally easy so it tries it first
. places anchor in receptor
. scores orientations
* tries some number of orientations
* takes top 100 orientations associated to best energy
. adds the rest of the molecule layer by layer
. repeats until the whole molecule is tested

Eventually it finds the best conformation linked to the best (lowest) interaction energy

* ideally it's the bioactive conformation

==== Genetic algorithms

Consider the whole conformation

. Initialization
* randomly generate a population of solutions
. Selection
* keep the top 10 solution
. Reproduction
* build new solutions based on top 10 solutions
. New and old populations are merged
* basically mimics evolution kinda
. Repeat
