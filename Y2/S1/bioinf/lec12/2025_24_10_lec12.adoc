== Where do we find information?

There are a whole bunch of interlinked databases

. Nucleotide sequences:
* ENA
* GenBank
* INDSC
. Genes
* NCBI Gene
** proteins and the genes that produce them have the same name (lol???) but different IDs
** different research groups can name the same protein/gene/whatever differently
*** databases list synonyms as well
* GeneCards
** less about data
** more about generic information
. Genomes/proteome/transcriptome
* GenBank
. Genome Browsers
* ensembl
** shows gene location in genome
** shows gene isoforms
** autologs: same gene different life form
** paralogs: something else idk
** shows phenotypes: expression of genes (eye color, hair color, pea color, pea texture, etc.)

Most of these have APIs to make automatic interaction easier

== How is this information written?

=== FASTA

Seen before

Used for known sequences

ATAGCAC and such

=== Transcript Annotation Files

Used to encode transcripts

. https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md[GFF]
* GFF2 represented 2 levels of feature hierarchy
* GFF3 can represent any number of features in a hierarchy
. GTF
* identical to GFF2

GFF files:

* Plain text 
* 9 columns
** code
** gene part
** start point
** end point
** other stuff
* tab delimited

=== UTR

Regions on RNA extremes remain untranslated

They are required for translation but they themselves are not translated

* key regulatory regions

One at 3'

* determines lifetime of RNA

One at 5'

* located before the start codon (AUG)

== Sequence Analysis

How do we analyze these sequences?

=== Pattern Matching

Similar patterns can indicate similar functions

Can be used to reconstruct genome/gene/protein evolution

2 main ways:

* exact pattern matching
** find ATAGC in human genome
* inexact pattern matching
** A*AGC in human genome
** nightmare in bioinf

Need the right algorithm for the job

.Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm
. preprocess steps
* construct Longest Proper Prefix that is also a Suffix
i dont understand lol

.Regular Expressions
* Useful in genomes because fixed sequences
* Letters outside ATGCU signify other things
** nucleotide IUPAC
* Amino acids only use IUPAC
** no weirdness

=== Codons to amino acids

3 codons make an amino acid

Wheel that maps starting codon to amino acids

* U -> U -> U or C => phenyline

WARNING: this wheel does not apply to all living beings. Some bacteria and human mithocondria have exceptions
