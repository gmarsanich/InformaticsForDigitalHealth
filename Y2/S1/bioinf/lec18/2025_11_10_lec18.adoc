== Phylogenetic Analysis Algorithms

A lot of phylogenetic tree construction problems become NP hard

* require a lot of sequence alignments
** they become intractable after ~10 sequences
* naive/trivial solutions aren't good enough

Have to use more specialized algorithms

=== Branch and Bound

Instead of building all trees and picking the best:

* build trees one by one and step by step
* any partial tree that doesn't beat the previous best score is discarded
** initial best score can be obtained by a heuristic tree

Good for up to 20 sequences

=== Maximum likelihood

Probabilistic approach

Estimates the likelihood of possible trees

Still computationally intensive

* NP hard

Use a pruning algorithm to reduce complexity

== Motif Discovery Algorithms

Non-trivial patterns shared across multiple sequences

* meaningful functions

Motifs can be indicators of similar/same functions
