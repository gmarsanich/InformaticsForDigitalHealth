== What is it?

Creating a model of new molecules with certain biological features

3D space arrangement of chemical features required for the molecule to interact with biological compound

* specific pharmacophore features
* represented by spheres

=== How?

. Collect data
* Gather information from multiple sources about molecules of interest
* paper P found that molecule X is active against our target
* different paper found molecule H that is also active against our target with other properties
. Analyze data
* Create a framework that integrates the collected data
. Design new molecules
* Create new molecules with the properties we identified during analysis
* Modify molecule X -> molecule Y
* Modify molecule H -> Molecule Y2
** X and H may be patented so beware

=== Simple example

Consider *Molecule A* and *Molecule B*

* structurally dissimilar
* both active against some target *T*
* we know their bioactive conformation
** we know how they interact with *T*'s binding site

.Steps

3D x-ray structure is required

. Superimpose A and B
* A binds to the receptor in conformation CA
* B binds to the receptor in conformation CB
** this shows common conformational features
** e.g. both have 3 aromatic rings and all 3 rings are in the same arrangement in both molecules
. Take common features
* in our case these would be the 3 aromatic rings
. Find molecules with similar features
* molecules with 3 aromatic rings with the same arrangement as A and B

.New Steps

What if you don't have the 3D x-ray structure?

* pairwise alignment of each conformation of both molecules
* find the superposition with the best alignment of certain parts of the molecules
* there can be multiple solutions that need to be tested later

=== Case Study - MbtI

Kill enzyme that helps tuberculosis bacteria consume iron ions

Kill enzyme -> no iron ions -> bacterium dies

Filter 1.5m complexes -> 2k complexes with the required features

* need to use HTS for this
* far too many molecules/complexes to do manually
* make the robot do it
* HTS is stupid expensive
** 100k compounds ~> 500k euro

HTS outputs are noisy

* many false positives
* many false negatives
* true positives don't tell you how the interaction happens

* Use docking

Many docking softwares

* which do you use?

Use multiple docking softwares and compare the results

* if 9/10 docking softwares predict the same ligand pose then that pose is more likely to be real

This is *consensus docking*
