== Proteins and 3D structures

Proteins are 3D structures

Their structure can be understood using x-ray crystallography

The output is stored in PDB

FASTA is a 1D representation of a 3D protein

== AlphaFold (Google)

Generates protein folds using multiple FASTA representations

* uses multiple sequence alignment
* AlphaFold 2 can do single proteins
** open source
* AlphaFold 3 can predict protein complexes
** closed source

== ESMAtlas (Meta)

Faster than AlphaFold but less confident

* does not perform MSA
