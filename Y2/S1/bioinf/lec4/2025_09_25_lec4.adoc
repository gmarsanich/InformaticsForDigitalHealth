== Protein representation

Many ways to represent proteins

AlphaFold can represent tertiary structures

* a single polypeptide chains

AlphaFold struggles with quaternary structures

* multi-polypeptide chains

All proteins can be one of these 2 shapes in their secondary structure:

.Beta Sheets
Indicator of stability

The more beta sheets there are in a tertiary structure the more stable a protein is

.Alpha Helixes
Less stable

Moves more freely

* like a spring

=== Space filling model

Each atom is given a color and is represented by a sphere

=== Stick model

Semi-linear shapes 

Square-ish shapes

Shapes are color coded

They represent beta sheets and alpha helix (see later)

=== Ribbon model

Alpha helixes are drawn as helixes

Beta sheets are flat

=== Common bonds

Important becaues of acid/base compounds

Acid compounds have a lot of H+

* compete with existing hydrogen bonds and can mess with structures

Basic compounds have a lot of OH-

* similar thing happens

If a cell's pH changes it can seriously mess up the organism


.Hydrogen bond
Forms bonds with negatively charged ions (atoms?)

Holds DNA together

Not very strong but very common

.Hydrophobic interactions
Weak bonds between groups that ignore water

they are stable regardless of pH

Hydrophobic interactions

.Sulfide bridges
Stronger than hydrogen bond
also stable regardless of pH

* Cystine has a sulfide bridge

.Ionic bonds
Slightly stronger than hydrogen bonds

Simple electrostatic charge bonds

== Hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules 

The type of bond depends on the environment proteins are found in

* watery environment -> kick out charged R groups
* lipid environment -> kick out hydrophobic groups
* amphipathic -> can be in either
** lysine has a long chain so it can deal with either environment

You could engineer a polypeptide chain that has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides it can rotate accordingly

* hydrophilic part inside water
* hydrophobic outside

Cholesterol does this

* LDL and HDL have different properties
* ratio of one wrp to the other depends on blood state

The active site of the hand enzyme is inside a hydrophobic pocket

Albumin changes irreversibly when exposed to heat

* bonds are broken
* completely changes structure of the protein 

This is called *denaturation*

Denaturation can be reversed if sulfide bonds are unbroken

== Working with proteins

Give proteins a tertiary structure

* how do they crystallyze?
* what do they become?

Find biochemical functions

* what do these proteins do?

Find regulation/modulation activities

* how do they affect other reactions?

=== 3D visualization

==== Cryo-electron microscopy

Flash freezing dried molecule samples with non crystalline ice

* needs to be extremely fast or use anti freeze type solvents
* water *cannot* be allowed to crystallize
** icicles can break the protein itself and destroy it

==== X-ray diffraction

measures the amount of electrons around certain atoms

knowing the number of electrons in bonds gives us information about the type of bonds

this works if you know what youre putting in the machine

* it only shows you the 3D structure

==== Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

Measures the resonance of the atoms

Computes the distance between them

Reconstructs 3D structure

=== Function identification

==== Column Chromatography

Chemical method for finding the function of a protein

Given a matrix of inert material

Put protein on top of matrix

* + protein needs - matrix

As protein moves down bonds will form and break

Protein will separate from the rest

Put solvent in surviving protein

Split protein from matrix

==== Electrophoresis

Visualizes and characterizes purified proteins

Use electricity to move proteins

Uses a gel with - electrode at top and + electrode at bottom

Charged proteins will go towards the pole with opposite charge (we don't want this)

SDS detergent is used to set all protein charges to -

* all proteins will go down

Gel pores regulate the sizes of proteins that can go to either pole

* smaller proteins will get to the bottom first

Since we know the voltage and time we can estimate/measure the charge to mass ratio

Antibodies are used to identify proteins in the output

* attach bioluminescent compound to antibody

==== 2D electrophoresis

Done typically on blood and tissue samples

* too many proteins
* output gets crowded

Proteins are separated vertically and horizontally

* smaller go down first and go lower
* different shapes spread horizontally

==== Mass spectrometry

Works with non-protein molecules as well (like fatty acids)

In proteins it breaks the amino acid sequence in specific places

* accurately returns the amino acids in the chain

Steps:

. Ionization breaks the protein down and charges it
* uses charged laser pulse (+/-)
* can also force the protein to evaporate (nebulization)
. introduce these molecules to electric/magnetic field
. molecules are distributed across different parts of the field
* *mass to charge ratio* stem:[\frac{m}{z}]
. Use software to estimate the mass

==== Liquid Chromatography-tandem MS

Combines chromatography to isolate protein

Protein is put into mass spectrometer to reconstruct sequence

Can be used to discover unknown proteins

==== Fluorescence

Really focuses on function

Color coded antibodies bind to specific molecules

if colors merge it means that the 2 molecules interact

=== Regulation of protein function

Going from an existing but non functional form to a functional form requires some kind of chemical change

* charge
* hydrophobia
* lipophilia

==== Activation Mechanisms

.Conformational Chnages
binding of another molecule activates the protein

.(De)Phosphorylation
addition/removal of phosphate group changes activation based on the protein

this can be used to generate a protein that's always active as long as it has phosphate bound to a specific R group

* substitute amino acids that cant take phosphate to permanently enable proteins that only work if phosphate is unbound

*Phosphomimetic* molecules:

* Tyr
* Ser
* Thr
* His

.Nucleotide exchange
Humans work on ATP

G proteins are inactive when bound with GDP and are active using GTP

changind the D to a T activates a protein

.Cleavage
Cutting off parts of proteins

== Signal Transduction

.Specificity

A ligand fits with its specific receptor

.Sensitivity

a single receptor has a specific sensitivity for its ligand

.Amplification
When enzymes activate other enzymes there is an activation cascade called *enzyme cascade*

* the number of affected molecules increases geometrically

.Modularity

Binding modules can be attached/detatched depending on the environment

.Desensitization/Adaptation

When a receptor is activated a feedback circuit shuts it off or removes it from the cell surface

.Divergence

When a receptor is active it opens multiple pathways with different effects

.Integration

When 2 signals on 2 receptors have opposite effects on a metabolic characteristic the outcome of the regulation is given by combining the input of both receptors

.Localized response

When the enzyme that destroys and intracellular message is clustered with the message producer it is degreded before the message spreads

* there are enzymes that destroy messages
* when that enzyme is near the receptor that sends the message it intercepts the message and degrades it

Cross talk is very common and very complex

* eye sees food and stomach rumbles

== Bioinformatics

Computationally identify functional segments in new proteins

Compute the degree of homology between 2 different molecules

* how many proteins are the same in 2 different molecules

*SWISS-MODEL*

Uses FASTA-like syntax

Use structures of known proteins to compute the 3D structure of a new target unknown folded protein
