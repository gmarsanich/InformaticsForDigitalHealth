== What is it?

The dynamic motions of molecular systems

* flexibility of micro/macro molecules

Extension of molecular mechanics

=== Definition

Atoms are particles that respond to Newton's motion equation

* atom A feels a force in some direction -> it will move in that direction
* the direction changes -> A is pulled/pushed somewhere else

Doing it continuously is very hard

Can discretize it to get close enough

If we can calculate the acceleration felt by A in delta T we can estimate the force felt by A

* how do we calculate the acceleration?
* use *force fields*
* update position at each frame

==== Example

Consider carbon dioxide (CO2)

* very simple molecule (O-C-O)

It can change in a lot of ways

* stretching
** symmetric -> both bonds stretch equally
** asymmetric -> one bond stretches differently than the other
* bending -> bonds can bend up and down
* rotational motion
** atoms can rotate
* translational motion
** it can move in space

== Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Useful for simulating experiments that are impractical in the real world

The required equations are very complex

* no analytical solutions
* different algorithms are required
* need to pick the right algorithm for the job

The motion is divided into time steps (delta T)

* this applies to *all* algorithms

=== Problems

==== Time

But how short can delta T be?

* needs to be short enough to compute precise force and velocity vectors for each atom
* this implies that the time step needs to be so short that no movement occurs
* delta T cannot be lower than the most common atomic motion time
* delta T cannot be higher than the fastest atomic motion (sigma bonds with hydrogen atoms)
* delta T = 1 femtosecond
** 1 microsecond of simulation is a billion samples
** like filming Oppenheimer at 300 fps
** can use delta T = 2 femtosecond if you constrain hydrogen bonds to a fixed distance
* simulation times are kept very short (10s-100s of nanoseconds)
* good computers can generate nanoseconds per day (lol?)

==== Solvents

What do we do with the solvents?

Simulating RNA and DNA requires taking water into account

* cells are mostly water

Solvents can be considered:

.Implicit

Ignore it

. Pick a constant depending on solvent
* Consider that based on reciprocal distances atoms feel different polarizability
. Use a continuum model
* molecules are immersed in continuous fluid
** ignore molecules
** Generalized Born/Poisson-Boltzmann models

These methods are used when considering individual molecules is impractical

.Explicit

Take water individual water molecules into account

But:

* how much solvent is there?
* What is beyond the solvent?
** is there a wall for solute molecules to bounce into/away from?

Use *periodic boundary conditions*

* do like Pac-Man
** if cross border -> return from opposite side

. Replicate the simulation area in all directions infinitely
. Molecule movements are mapped
. Molecule from simulation exits right -> molecule from left replica enters left

=== MD simulation steps

. Initial coordinates
* where is the initial position of the object?
. Create the system
* solvents, atoms
. Add energy to the system
* heat up the system
* constant volume until physiological temp (~300 Kelvin)
. Equilibration dynamics
* system received a lot of energy so things are moving around
* need movements to converge to some non erratic value
* needs constant pressure
. Production dynamics
* physiological-like environment
. Trajectory analysis
* calculate values at each frame -> final trajectory
* MD movie

==== Trajectory Analysis

Can compute RMSD (ligand position in frame i initial conformation) in each frame

* RMSD oscillates so take the mean

Can also compute for other elements of system

* e.g. alpha carbons

Can also evaluate stability of certain bonds

* e.g Hydrogen bonds
* compute distance between hydrogen and other atom(s) for each frame
* if bond exists for 90% of frames then the bond is stable

Can compute RMSF (root mean square fluctuation)

* compute RMSD for alpha carbons for each amino acid in protein
* each point represents mean RMSD alpha carbons in each amino acids
* lower RMSF -> more stable w.r.p to initial conformation

=== MD for conformational search

Classic minimization algorithms cannot overcome energy barriers between local minima

* MD can dynamically overcome energy barriers

Can simulate energy source (i.e. heat)

* molecules can now overcome barrier
* new local minima can be found

Higher temp -> higher kinetic energy

* if temp is high enough it can sample the entire surface
* not possible in practice because it would take too long

== MD algorithms

Use these algorithms to increase conformational space of the protein I want to assemble:

* simulated annealing
* steered MD
* coarse grained

=== Simulated Annealing

Conformational analysis of large systems

Increase the temperature of a system to ~2000/3000 Kelving

* without denaturating
* gives enough energy to overcome energy barriers

Slowly reduce the temperature (like in PCR)

* system is trapped in low energy conformation

If you repeat this you can trap the system in a different energy well

=== Steered MD

Used to force some rare events

* e.g. dissociation of ligand from receptor binding pocket
* this would require hundreds of microseconds
** impractical because it would take months of computing time

Apply a specific force in a specific point steer the event

* e.g. apply a small constant force a molecule to go through a certain passage
* give it barely enough energy to move

This is generally performed multiple times

* use different energy each time
* pick the lowest energy required
