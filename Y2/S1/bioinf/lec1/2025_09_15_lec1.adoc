. Questions on computational drug discovery and design (20 points)

=== Assignment

. Exercises on bioinformatics and systems biology
. Oral discussion on exercises


== Cell functioning basics

* DNA is the source code of the cell
** genes can be transcribed into RNA -> proteins
* Genes activate/inhibit each other
* RNA delivers DNA info through the cell
* Proteins run the cell
** many types
** they participate in chemical reactions
** a network of reactions related to a particular function is called a pathway

These are all sequences: 

* DNA is a sequence of nucleotides
** `A T C G`
** human DNA has 2 sequences that merge into helix
** you can derive a sequence from its complement

* RNA is also a sequence of nucleotides
** `A U C G`
** RNA is obtained by a DNA transcription

* Proteins are sequences of amino acids
** 20 amino acids (`alphabet[:20]`)
. Primary structure
. Secotdary structure
. Tertiary structure
. Quaternary structure
** Proteins can be 100s of amino acids

There are rules that determine how these sequences can be formed

== Sequence level operations on biological structures

* Parsing and storage
* Sequence alignment
* Assembly
** DNA/molecule sequencing
** building long sequences from short sequences
* Motif/pattern finding
* Variant calling
** detecting mutations (insertions/deletions, SNPs)
* Annotation
** linking sequences to functions

== 3D representations of molecules

Using coordinates to place each atom of each amino acid in a 3D space

== Biological networks

. Gene regulatory networks
* describe influence (inhibition/activation) between genes
* `A` activates `B` which inhibits `C` and so on
* we can simulate gene `D = off` and see how it affects the rest of the network 

. Cell pathways
* Describe chemical reactions in cells
* More detailed descriptions than GRNs

. Protein-protein Interaction networks (PPI)
* Describe interaction between proteins
* Undirected graph where nodes are proteins and arcs are interactions between them
