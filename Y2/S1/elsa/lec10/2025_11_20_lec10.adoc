== General Data Protection Framework

=== Historical Evolution

Privacy has been a topic of discussions for a while (long before digital world)

We went from a directive to a regulation

* directive -> general rule
** member states apply them according to their preference (terms and conditions apply)
** formalistic approach
*** bureaucratic
*** required noticing the local privacy entity that personal data was being processed
* regulation -> strict rule
** member states must apply it exactly as written (?)
** accountability approach
*** data consumers are held accountable for the data they handle

Data users/consumers need to use the least data possible

* like the principle of least privilege
* they must include privacy in the application/database design
* privacy must be by default

CAUTION: data belongs to the owner, not the company that uses them

.What is Personal Data?

Personal data is *any* information that can be used to identify a person

Such as but not limited to:

* name
* last name
* date of birth
* username
* location

.What is Data Processing?

It is the:

* storage
* transmission
* recording
* consultation
* use
* dissemination

of personal data

CAUTION: the person physically processing the data may not be responsible for them. It may be the organization they are employed by

WARNING: data is allowed to be processed by a single entity. If a different entity/process needs access they need to obtain explicit consent

== Principles of Data Processing

GDPR has 7 main principles

. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
* processing personal data requires a legal base (GDPR art. 6.1.<x>)
** consent
** contractual necessity
** legal obligation
* Users/data owners must know what their data is being used for and by whom
** simple
** easy to understand

. Purpose limitation
* Data must be used for a specific purpose
** the owner of the data must be notified of said purpose
** they must consent to use for that purpose

. Data minimization
* Use the smallest amount of data possible to satisfy a specific purpose
** predicting cancer does not require patient name/last name/home address

. Accuracy
* Data must be accurate
** inaccurate data may compromise the health/other aspects of the data owner's life

. Storage limitation
* Data cannot be stored indefinitely
* When its purpose is fulfilled it needs to either:
** be anonymized and archived
** destroyed

. Integrity and confidentiality
* Data must be protected from unauthorized access

. Accountability
* The data processor is accountable for what happens to the data

== Data Subject Rights

Owners of data (*data subjects*) have rights

. Information
* the right to know what's being done to their data

. Access
* the right to know whether their data is being/has been processed
* the right to obtain a copy of their data
** who/what accessed their data

. Rectification
* the right to correct/update information
** related to the principle of accuracy

. Erasure
* the right for data to be deleted forever from the universe

. Restriction of processing
* the right to restrict the processing of personal data
** if data is inaccurate
** if processing is illegal

. Data portability
* the right to transfer the same data to a different entity
** transferring phone numbers from provider A to provider B
** transferring blood test from clinic C to hospital H

. Right to object
* the right to not give consent
** "I don't consent to my personal information to be used for personalized advertising"

. Automated decision making (GDPR art.22)
* the right to oppose decisions based on automated processing if this processing can have adverse effects
** i.e. the right to choose whether a human processes their data
* also part of the AI Act

== Health Data

Health data is data related to the physical/mental health of a person

Includes:

* clinical tests
* diagnoses
* prescription
* biometric data

but also:

* data from wellness/fitness apps
** sleep trackers
** heart rate trackers
* health appointment reminders
* dietary habits
* other connected medical devices

Health data is especially sensitive

* GDPR *prohibits* the treatment of health data *UNLESS* certain conditions apply
** explicit consent
*** patient P allows the hospital to use their results to train a model to recognize tumors
** healthcare provision
*** doctor D can access health information for unconscious patient P to save their life
** public health
*** public health emergencies (pandemics and such) override personal consent for the good of the community
** research/statistics/archival

Health data must not be (easily) retraced back to the data subject

* anonymization (name -> UUID64)
* pseudoanonymization (fiscal code)

Special considerations have to be used if data needs to leave the EU

* adequacy treaties
