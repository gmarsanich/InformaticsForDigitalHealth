== Medical Device Definition

Devices that come into contact with patients

* pacemaker
* hospital bed
* wheelchair
* MRI machine

etc.

=== Is a product a medical device?

We have a product

. Does it have a medical purpose?
* no -> not a medical device
* yes -> does it operate metabolically/pharmacologically?
** yes -> medicinal product
** no -> hardware product -> *medical device*

For example an insulin pump has

* a needle/pump -> medical device
* insulin -> not a medical device (medicinal product)

Who decides?

=== Medical Device Regulation

The *Medical Device Regulation (MDR)* from the European Commission

* replaced the *Medical Device Directive* from 1993

Regulation implies standardization

* the old directive allowed forking
** Germany had MDD + own rules
** France had MDD + own rules

Now France and Germany have MDR and not their own rules

Components:

* 123 articles
** Art.2 -> Definition
*** has a whole bunch of definitions for what's in the document
** Art.10 -> Obligations
*** anyone involved with a device has some obligations
* 17 annexes
** Annex VIII -> classification and risk rules
*** what makes a device class 1, 2, 3?
** Annex IX -> declaration of conformity
*** rules for defining when a product is ready
** Annex I -> general performance and safety requirements
*** what does it need to be safe?
** Annex II -> technical documentation
*** hardware and software components
*** user manual

==== Active devices

There are also *active devices* that depend on external energy source (i.e. not generated by the human body)

* battery powered devices
* mains powered devices
** extension cords are not active devices

Software is also considered an active device because it depends entirely on something that is powered

==== Accessories for medical devices

Certain parts of a system can be considered accessories if they can be used alongside medical devices

== Risk based classes

There is a decision pipeline to follow to determine the class of the device

. Decide the type of device
* (non)invasive
* active/passive
* special product

. Look at each MDR classification rule
* find the one that applies

. If multiple rules apply pick the highest risk rule

. If the product is combined then die idk

=== Risk based classes rules

Rules are specific questions that are used to determine the device's class

22 total rules

* 4 rules for invasive devices
* 4 rules for non invasive devices
* 4 rules for active devices
* 9 rules for special devices

Class flow:

. Is it non active/non implantable/non invasive?
* yes -> Class 1 device
* no -> next question
. Is it invasive for long term use?
* no -> Class 2A
* yes -> Class 2B/3
. Does it emit/control energy?
* no -> 2A
* yes -> next question
. Is it implantable/sustaining life
* no -> not necessarily class 3
* yes -> class 3

This is more of a guideline

* gray areas by design
* depends on specific case

Each class may have multiple subclasses

* higher numbers have higher associated risk

==== Classes

Class 1 has the lowest risk

Manufacturers can self certify

* System quality (ISO 13485)
* Risk management
* Technical documentation
* Declaration of conformity
* CE mark as well

If something goes wrong then they are wholly responsible

Class 1 subclasses require an authorized third party to do review and assess the documentation

* 1S: sterile
* 1M: measuring function 
* 1R: reusable

Classes 2 and 3 require authorized third party by default

== Medical Devices and Digital Health

Big overlap

* Mobile health apps
* Wearables
* AI and data analysis

Not all wearables are medical devices

== Software
