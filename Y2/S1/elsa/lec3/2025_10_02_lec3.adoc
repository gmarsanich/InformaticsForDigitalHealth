== Medical Device Definition

Devices that come into contact with patients

* pacemaker
* hospital bed
* wheelchair
* MRI machine

etc.

=== Is a product a medical device?

We have a product

. Does it have a medical purpose?
* no -> not a medical device
* yes -> does it operate metabolically/pharmacologically?
** yes -> medicinal product
** no -> hardware product -> *medical device*

For example an insulin pump has

* a needle/pump -> medical device
* insulin -> not a medical device (medicinal product)

Who decides?

=== Medical Device Regulation

The *Medical Device Regulation (MDR)* from the European Commission

* replaced the *Medical Device Directive* from 1993

Regulation implies standardization

* the old directive allowed forking
** Germany had MDD + own rules
** France had MDD + own rules

Now France and Germany have MDR and not their own rules

Components:

* 123 articles
** Art.2 -> Definition
*** has a whole bunch of definitions for what's in the document
** Art.10 -> Obligations
*** anyone involved with a device has some obligations
* 17 annexes
** Annex VIII -> classification and risk rules
*** what makes a device class 1, 2, 3?
** Annex IX -> declaration of conformity
*** rules for defining when a product is ready
** Annex I -> general performance and safety requirements
*** what does it need to be safe?
** Annex II -> technical documentation
*** hardware and software components
*** user manual

==== Active devices

There are also *active devices* that depend on external energy source (i.e. not generated by the human body)

* battery powered devices
* mains powered devices
** extension cords are not active devices

Software is also considered an active device because it depends entirely on something that is powered

==== Accessories for medical devices

Certain parts of a system can be considered accessories if they can be used alongside medical devices

== Risk based classes

There is a decision pipeline to follow to determine the class of the device

. Decide the type of device
* (non)invasive
* active/passive
* special product

. Look at each MDR classification rule
* find the one that applies

. If multiple rules apply pick the highest risk rule

. If the product is combined then die idk

=== Risk based classes rules

Rules are specific questions that are used to determine the device's class

22 total rules

* 4 rules for invasive devices
* 4 rules for non invasive devices
* 4 rules for active devices
* 9 rules for special devices

Class flow:

. Is it non active/non implantable/non invasive?
* yes -> Class 1 device
* no -> next question
. Is it invasive for long term use?
* no -> Class 2A
* yes -> Class 2B/3
. Does it emit/control energy?
* no -> 2A
* yes -> next question
. Is it implantable/sustaining life
* no -> not necessarily class 3
* yes -> class 3

This is more of a guideline

* gray areas by design
* depends on specific case

Each class may have multiple subclasses

* higher numbers have higher associated risk

==== Classes

Class 1 has the lowest risk

Manufacturers can self certify

* System quality (ISO 13485)
* Risk management
* Technical documentation
* Declaration of conformity
* CE mark as well

If something goes wrong then they are wholly responsible

Class 1 subclasses require an authorized third party to do review and assess the documentation

* 1S: sterile
* 1M: measuring function 
* 1R: reusable

Classes 2 and 3 require authorized third party by default

== Medical Devices and Digital Health

Big overlap

* Mobile health apps
* Wearables
* AI and data analysis

Not all wearables are medical devices

== Software

.MDR definition
A set of instructions that processes input data and creates output

Different types of softwares

. Accessory software
* no independent medical function
* supports primary medical device
* hardware can also be accessory to software

. Software in a Medical Device (SiMD)
* integral part of medical device
** insulin pump regulator
** pacemaker firmware

. Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)
* no hardware required
* software is the medical device
** melanoma recognition app

=== Software Qualification

. Does this software help diagnosis, treatment, etc.?
* no -> not a medical device
. Is the software accessory to a medical device?
* yes -> software is a medical device
. Does the software operate on data beyond storage/retrieval?
* no -> not a medical device
. Does the software benefit patients?
* no -> not a medical device

Some examples of healthcare software

* hospital information system
* decision support software
* electronic health records
* telemedicine
* web systems for monitoring

=== Risk Classification for SaMD

If software works as a decision support system:

* class IIa

If decisions may cause:

* death -> class III
* health deterioration -> class IIb

If software monitors physiological processes:

* class IIa

If changes in physiological processes/parameters can bring harm to the patient:

* class IIb

Else:

* class I

If MDSW is part of MDHW:

* MDSW risk class == MDHW risk class

If MDSW is standalone:

* risk class is independent of other hardware

=== Apps on online platforms

All medical apps must comply with rgulations regardless of app cost or source

* publishing app on platform -> placing on market
* availability for download -> making available on market

CAUTION: manufacturer is *always* responsible for compliance

App platform providers have 2 roles:

. Intermediary
* connect users and developers
* handle user reports
* ensure transparency

. Distributor/importer
* ensure safety

=== AI as SaMD

MDR and AI Act apply simultaneously when AI is used in SaMD

MDCG is being created

* defines guidelines for interplay between MDR and AI Act
** basically FAQ
* talks about MDAI
* split into chapters

WARNING: still being developed as of 2025-10-16

== Cybersecurity

Medical devices can be vulnerable to cyber attacks

* supply chain attack on pacemaker firmware can cause malfunctions and lead to death

Manufacturers must ensure safety/security by design and maintain post market surveillance

Need to ensure protection against data theft and data leaks

== Ethics Committees

Ethics committees are independent bodies that ensure the protection of rights, safety and well being of human subjects in clinical activities. 

Ethics committees must be independent to lower the chances of biased judgement

* no subordination to clinical structure where the committee works

There are 43 ethics committees in Italy

* 40 regional committees -> CET
** drug trials
** clinical investigations of MDs
** observational pharmacological studies
* 3 national committees -> CEN
** advanced therapies
** medical product trials

National committees aren't always composed of the same members

* sometimes they split

Ethics committees must wholly approve the study for the study to be approved

Ministry must also approve the study but minitry approval requires ethics committee approval

Can send proposal to both in parallel to save a bit of time

=== Choosing an ethics committee

The chosen committee needs to be valid for the given study

* pediatric studies need an EC that deals with pediatrics

Study sponsors/promoters are responsible for finding correct EC

* pharma companies that ask clinical centers to run a study
* clinical centers themselves

=== Informed Consent

All studies requiring people need an informed consent form/document

* attests that participants are taking part willingly and they can leave at any time

MDR rules and ISO standards for informed consent

WARNING: no informed consent = no study

Informed consent forms must be in plain language

* no legalese
* no tricks
* no loopholes

Other requirements:

* No coercion
* no reward
** if you participate we'll give you 100 euro

Vulnerable subjects can obtain consent from legal representative or caregivers

* subject assent if possible

== Clinical Studies

=== Clinical investigation

A systematic investigation of at least one human subjects to assess the performance/safety of a device

* demonstrates safety and clinical performance of device
* obtain/maintain CE marking
* generate real world data to improve the device

Clinical investigations of medicinal products follow different rules:

* CTR
* safety and efficacy of product
* randomized double blind
* different ISO standard
