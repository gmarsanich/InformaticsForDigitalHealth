== What is a DSS?

Digital system that makes/suggests decisions according to some data

* if heartbeat > 150 => go hospital
* if blood sugar < 0.01 => go hospital

Device that collects data needs to be certified (MDR)

Algorithm in DSS also needs to be certified

All functions need to be certified/validated

* applies to EHR as well
** EHR can be at worst class IIB because doctors make decisions
* how do you decide that a patient is more complex than another?

=== Design overview

Using microservices and modularity makes it easier

* segregating components increases safety
** changes to accounting service has no impact on clinical services

Choose (a)synchronous functions when appropriate

* if a function takes a day to return a value then use asynchronous
* if a function needs to return a result immediately then use synchronous
** depends on efficiency as well as priority
