== Budgeting and value over time

Hospital H spends 100k on something

* they are able to use the thing:tm: over the next 10 years
** basically a morgage
* the value of the thing outweighs its cost

Accounting sheets are split into 2 sections

. Production value (A)
* basically revenue
* *Contributi in conto esercizio (A.1)* contains resources given by the region to provide healthcare services
** regional health fund
** if CCE funds are spent on investments and not directly on healthcare services the entire cost of the investment must be spent within the year
* *Contributi in conto capitale* contains resources given by the region to invest
* *A.4* contains revenue from healthcare activities
** people spend a bit of money to receive a service
** that money goes into this section
* *A.6* contains money received through day hospital fees
. Production costs (B)
* *B.1* acquisition of consumable goods (65% of the costs)
** health goods
*** medications
*** medical/diagnostic equipment
** non health goods
*** pens
*** paper
*** food
* *B.2* acquisition of health services
** when person P receives healthcare outside the ASL's area
** when person P receives healthcare at an accredited private clinic
* *B.5* usage of third party goods/services
** renting space
** renting networking

== Diagnosis Related Groups

Classification tool for classifying patients based on their diagnosis and the resources used to treat them

* after a hospital stay patients are given a DRG code based on a multitude of factors
** diagnosis
** complications
** patient characteristics
* DRGs are the same across all regions
** associated costs are not the same across all regions
*** they are decided by the region
*** what happens when patient P (linked to ASL A) goes to a hospital in ASL B?
*** they pay a *TUC (Tariffa Unica Convenzionale)*

== Spending ceilings

The Ministry of Economics and Finances manages healthcare finances as well

All healthcare facilities cannot spend more than their ceilings

2 main spending ceilings:

. Personnel costs (1.4% of their revenue)
* hiring
* payroll
. Medical costs (4.4% of their revenue)
* medications
* medical devices

If they go over the ceiling they aren't allowed to spend any more

* personnel costs are very strict
* medical costs are a bit more lax
** there is a payback mechanism -> if region/AO goes over ceiling -> medication provider is required to contribute 50% of the extra
*** pharmaceutical companies basically give away 50% of the revenue for sales that are over the AO's ceiling
*** this system doesn't take private clinics into account (!!!)

== Planning and budgeting

2 types of budgets

. 3 year investment plan (capital budget)
* expresses how a region plans to invest their investment budget in the next 3 years
. Budget (operational budget)
* documents that contain objectives and results
