== Overview

EU robotics/AI resolutions and such have been a thing since around 2015

The 2017 robolaw resolution lumped all robotics together

* autonomous cars
* exoskeletons

It was way too broad to ever be applicable

* focused on responsibility and prevention of accidents
** who is responsible if Bobert is trapped in his exoskeleton?

European Commission started working on AI specific rulesets in 2018

* AI for Europe (2018)
* AI Act (2021)

== Road to AI regulation

Regulators went from robotics to AI

High risk AI products are more strictly regulated than low risk products

* providers/manufacturers must ensure that the products they ship are adequately safe

=== Defining AI

Before proper regulations/legislations can be implemented we need to know what AI really is

* technical definitions?
* legal definitions?

== Risk based approach

Risk levels are defined and represented as a pyramid

. Complete prohibition
* products/applications with unacceptable risk
** subliminal techniques
** manipulative/deceptive techniques
** techniques that cause significant harm
** systems that exploit users based on personal characteristics and cause them to behave unexpectedly
*** AI powered toy that causes children to put themselves in dangerous situations
. Requirements/conformity required
* high risk applications
. informational/transparency obligations
* medium/low risk
** inform users that they are interacting with an AI system
. no restrictions required
* low/no risk

=== High risk systems

High risk systems have strict requirements:

* high quality data
** clean
** low bias
** representative of reality
* documentation and logging
* transparency
* *human oversight (!!!)*
* robustness
* accuracy
* cybersecurity

2 subcategories of high risk systems:

. AI components/final products that would be subject to some other legislation
* some high risk device that has AI built in
* requires legislative verification

. Standalone AI components that are used in certain areas
* law enforcement
* immigration
* employment
* education
* access to essential services
* manufacturer has to run certification process
