=== Health as a dependent variable

Health is composed of biological factors

and external factors

=== Working model

Needs, demands and supply don't fully overlap

* needs aren't always expressed
* not all demands are met

=== Technology

Technology innovates faster:

* than we can adapt to it
* than systems can adapt to it

How do we harness it?
