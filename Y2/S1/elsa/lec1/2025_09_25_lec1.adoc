== What is Digital Health?

Use of information and telecommunication tech for the benefit of human health

=== eHealth

Healthcare supported by electronic systems and telecom tech

Focuses on infrastructure

=== mHealth

Medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices

* wearables
* phones

=== Telemedicine

Delivery of healthcare remotely

* virtual consultations
* remote diagnostics

=== Personalized Medicine

Uses individual characteristics to tailor treatment plans

* genetic data
* environmental data
* lifestyle data

=== Global Drivers of DH

.Aging population
* Age increases healthcare demand
* more chronic conditions
* more comorbid conditions

DH improves remote monitoring and home care

.Chronic Diseases
* Increasing prevalence of chronic diseases
** diabetes
** cardiovascular diseases
** cancer
* Need continuous monitoring

.Pandemics and other health crises
* ball

=== DH ecosystem

Many stakeholders to satisfy

Each has different goals

Goals must be coordinated

.Stakeholders
* Patients
** active participants
** track and share data
* Payers
** NHS
** insurance providers
* Providers
** doctors
** hospitals
** pharmacies
* Regulators
** FDA
** GDPR
** EMA
* IT 
** startups
** big tech

=== DH Pipeline

. People
* everything goes through people
* patients, clinicians, engineers, everyone
* most systems need to be human centered
. Data
* people give us data
* data is used to develop new things
** algorithms
** treatments
. Communication
* encryption
* tunneling
* protocols
. Storage and analysis
* HPC infrastructure
* energy costs and consumption
. Visualization
* visualizing and explaining results

== Clinical research lifecycle

How do we do research properly?

* Meticulous study design
* Enroll patients
* Plan data collection and storage
* monitor data for integrity
* analyze/visualize collected information
* Regulatory compliance
** slowest part

== Data

Data used to be exchanged between humans only

* SMS
* voice 
* telegraph

Then data started coming from the internet

* data created indirectly by humans

Now we have machines that communicate through the internet

* humans are last in the chain

We also have information exchange between machines only

Data is generated by multiple sources:

* users
** messages
** device interaction
* devices
* wearables
* opportunistic data
** data from context A used in context B
** cookies and data sharing meme (selling ads)

=== Big Data

Big data has cerain characteristics (all starting with V)

. Volume
* need a lot of data (like a LOT of data)
* hospitals can generate ~200 exabytes of data per year
** normal statistical models can't easily handle this volume of data
. Velocity
* data is generated and stored very quickly
. Variety
* data is multimodal
** same dataset has multiple types of data
* structured data
* semi structured data
* unstructured data
. Variability
* data is not always consistent
** gaps in longitudinal data
** different structures
. Veracity
* data needs to be reliable
** bad data is worse than no data
. Visualization
* you need to know what the output looks like
. Value
* data provides value
* research value
* money value

Data is challenging

* patients generate enormous amounts of data
* real time consultation is extremely useful 

Data is also multi modal

* timeseries
* images
* text
* medical imaging

These have to be processed in different ways

Multimodal data is interconnected

* how do we connect them meaningfully?

== Healthcare as an industry

Business but also service

* public health is important
* needs strict compliance with regulations and laws
** national/international regulations

Need to ensure:

* Efficiency
** resource allocation
* Quality
** high quality treatments
** evidence based care
* Safety
** do things correctly
** avoid medical errors
** unsafe care causes ~3 million deaths per year (worse in poorer countries)
** diagnostic errors can cause lifelong issues

Balancing these is extremely difficult

=== Integration Across Systems

Different places do things differently

* data exchange is difficult

Need to build *interoperability*

=== Digital Tools

.EHR
* centralized standardized data storage

.Clinical Decision Support Systems
* using ML to help clinical staff

.Process Optimization
* digital dashboards
* real time data visualization

.One Health Perspective
* linking environmental and epidemiological data
** link lung disease presence with air pollution data

== Certifications

Certifications ensure quality, safety and efficacy

All kinds of things need to be certified

* Medical devices
** Medical hardware
** Medical software
* Digital therapeutics
** software that delivers interventions
* Clinical Decision Support tools

Many standards

* GDPR
* whatever
* FDA
* HIPAA
* ISO
* HL7 (health level 7)
** standard for data interoperability
** OSI application layer standard

.HL7

Standard in development since late 80s

Many versions

Current (HL7 FHIR) uses REST/JSON

Uses standard codes to identify certain measurements/conditions

* 718-7 is hemoglobin mass/volume in blood

=== Certification Process and IP Management

.Generic certification process
. Classify product risk
* how likely is this product to harm the patient 
. Clinical evaluation
* how does it perform in clinical trials?
. Quality and risk management
. Data protection & cybersec
* where is data going?
* who has access?
* how is it protected?
. another thing that i forgor 

.generic IP management components

This is lawyer territory but it's good to know

Algorithms can be patented but it's more difficult than hardware

Methodologies are easier to patent

* still hard

Trade secrets for datasets and training pipelines can also be patented

Companies with nice methodologies and strong pipelines have a competitive advantage over others (boooo capitalism)

=== Technology Readiness Level

Technology Readiness Level (TLR) is a measurement system to assess tech maturity

Used in all parts of building a digital solution

9 stages

. Basic principles
. Concept formulated
. Experimental proof of concept
. Lab validation
. Pilot validation in relevant environment
* first validations in less lab like conditions
. Pilot demonstration in relevant environment
* shown to stakeholders
. Prototype in operational environment
. System complete and qualified
. Ready for production

Medical devices must be at least TRL 8 before entering the market

* certification opens the door to TRL 9

Digital Therapeutics requires TRL 6/7

* needs clinical validation to move forward

Clinical decision support tools need TRL 5-7

* need evidence of performance, validity and lack of bias

== Clinical Trials, ethics and health equity

These are required to develop DH solutions

=== Randomized Control Trials (RCT)

Take population

Randomly decide if you give them the product or not

* one group becomes the control group (no product)
* the other becomes experimental (has product)

Blinding hides group members from clinical staff

Outcome measurements need to be defined before starting analysis

* *Key performance indicator (KPI)* are generic success metrics

=== Ethics committees

Independent body composed of various experts

They check whether a study violates human rights and/or laws and such

They decide whether the study can go or not

They do these things:

* Sccientific and ethical review
** is this stuyd relevant?
** is this study ethical?

* Informed consent
** are patients aware of what they're getting into?

* Data protection and privacy
** ensure compliance with GDPR and friends
** (pseudo)anonmyzation
** data flow

* Vulnerable populations
** elderly and children have to be treated with special care

* Ongoing monitoring
** keep an eye on the study

Ethics committees don't like AI

* black box AI is cringe
* explainable AI is good but hard to implement (lol)

Cross border data transfer is also a problem

* study run in both USA and EU
* different data laws
* how handle?
