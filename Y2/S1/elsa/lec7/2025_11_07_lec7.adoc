== Hierarchy

The SSN follows a hierarchical system

. The state
* provides funding
* defines minimum assistance levels
. Regions
* plan and organize services
* distribute funding
. Clinics (ASL) and Hospitals (AO)
.. ASLs provide base medicine, mental health care, basic services
.. AOs are more complex systems
** they provide care for more complex needs

== Internal Organizational Levels

3 levels of responsibility:

. Strategic level
* defines objectives/targets
* defines overall mission
. Management level
* translates strategy into operational plans
. Operational level
* provides services based on operational plans

=== Business Management (Strategic Level)

Business Management branches are composed of multiple leaves

* General Director
* Healthcare Director
* Administrative Director

=== Operational Level

Multiple layers in this level too

==== Health Districts

Health districts coordinate assistance within their territory

* primary care
* home care
* consulting services
* mental health centers

They play a key role in the integration of health services with municipal social services

== Horizontal coordination and service integration

Sometimes different entities have to cooperate

Health Districts are responsible for this

* coordinate community centers with local hospitals

This isn't always easy

* different standards
* different expectations

=== Integrated Clinical Networks

A system used to define shared guidelines/protocols and data to guarantee treatment quality everywhere

.Cardiology network
* the cardiology network in Tuscany sends patients to the most appropriate center for their needs
* based on data/availability/treatment requirements

=== Integration tools

. Assistive diagnosis/therapy paths
* define care standards for various pathologies
* coordinate hospitals and regional services

. Continuative Care Units and Community Nursing (?)
* guarantee care during transitional periods
* monitor post-discharge health

. Remote coordination platforms
* remote management of patients and their data
* remote coordination between care providers

== LEA

LEA are Minimum Levels of Assistance/Care

3 main levels

. Collective prevention and public health
. District care
. something else

Designed to ensure all regions provide a minimum set of key services

This doesn't always work

=== Territorial Inequalities

Not all regions are able to provide the same quality of care

Southern regions cannot generally cope with healthcare demands

* high waiting times
* lower vaccination coverage
* lacking home care services
* lacking mental health care services
* old technologies

=== LEA monitoring

There are indicators that monitor LEA processes and results

* e.g. the process required to get a vaccine and the outcome
* e.g. cesarian births (c-sections)
** why were they required?
** what was the outcome?

These indicators are upated every year

== Digitalization of healthcare

Using modern technology to improve both managerial and care processes

Mainly electronic health records

* they allow patient data to be accessible by all management/care departments of all hospitals that use them

=== FSE 2.0

Digitally collects and stores the clinical history of all users

* reports
* prescriptions
* vaccines
* hospital stays
* diagnoses

=== Intelligent Care Providers

These would use:

* telemedicine
* remoter monitoring
* Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices
** for remote data collection
* AI and machine learning for data analysis
** diagnosis (DAS)
** customized therapies
* healthcare blockchains
** decentralized secure data storage and transmission
* apps and web portals to manage data

=== Process reorganization and digital skills

Processes need to be adapted to the use of technology

Staff needs to learn to use the new digital tools for them to be effective

* data usage and protection
* cybersecurity
* software usage
