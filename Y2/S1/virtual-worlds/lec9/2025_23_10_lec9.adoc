== What is an agentic system?

AI systems that operate without human intervention

Reactive to specific events

* they know what actions to take

Goal directed systems

. Rule based agents
* if `x` do `y`
. RL agents
* learn action `a` independently through experimentation
. LLM based agents
* use transformers and other modern tech to learn and execute actions 

== Agent Architecture Components

=== Perception

Taking in information about their environment

* text
* images
* other APIs

=== Control flow

Managing perception reasoning action loops

* what to do in each situation

=== Learning

=== Memory

=== Reasoning

=== Action

== LLM Based Agents

Learned on natural language

* generate code and other new information based on natural language

== Agent Planning Strategies
