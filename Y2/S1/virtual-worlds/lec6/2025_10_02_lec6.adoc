== What is WebGL?

Web based implementation of OpenGL

* JavaScript 3D graphics API
* Open standard (unlike DirectX)

Invented in ~2010

Runs in browsers

Cross platform and no installation required

Runs as a state machine

* state is set when API is called
* state changes with subsequent calls

[source,javascript]
----
const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl');

// Set clear color (R, G, B, A)
gl.clearColor(0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0);

// Clear the canvas
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

== WebGL architecture fundamentals

Some store data, others are pixel level

=== Color Buffer

Stores RGB(A) values

* alpha required for transparency
* also required for blending colors
* allows for addition, multiplication, of colors

Certain games (e.g. GTA) use the color buffer to store non color things like:

* lighting information

=== Depth Buffer

Stores depth values for 3D visibility

=== Stencil Buffer

Stores pixel masking for shadows and reflections

* basically all integers

== Data Buffer Operations and Management

Overview:

. Create buffer
* allocate memory
. Upload data
* write data to allocated memory
. Bind the buffer
* connect buffers to shader program
. Render the frame
* execute the draw calls

=== Buffer memory management

How do you manage buffers?

. Buffer creation

==== Example vertex attribute buffer configuration

. Position
* X, Y, Z components
** locations in 3D space
** WebGL automatically adds 1 to the 4th component
. Normal attributes
* ZX, NY, NZ components
* surface orientation for lighting
* the direction of the vector perpendicular to the surface at a given point
. UV attributes
* 2 components

=== Shader Program Management

. Create shader vertex
. Create fragment shader
. Link the program
. Handle errors

=== 3D camera system architecture

. Position
* where is the camera?
* camera is matrix
* point it where you want
* invert it
* ???
* profit
. Target
* what is camera looking at?
. Up vector
* camera orientation
* where is the camera oriented relative to the observer?
. Field of view

== Performance Optimization: LOD system

=== Frustum calling

If the object is outside the frustum it shouldn't render it

* saves up a bunch of resources and time

=== Batch rendering

Combine similar object if they are within another object's bounding box

== Interactive 3D Visualizations

A complete virtual world application has 5 ish components

. Scene management
. Material system
. User Interaction
. Performance optimization
