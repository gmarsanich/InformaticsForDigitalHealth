== Define Digital Twins

Digital copy of imaginary/real object

Extrapolate features and represent digitally

== DT maturity levels

. Static digital model
. Dynamic digital shadow
* automatic data flow
* real time state updates
. True digital twin
* bidirectional flow control
. Autonomous
* doesn't require intervention

== Types of digital twins

Product digital twins

* physical items

Process digital twins

* workflows and procedures

Systems digital twins

* Penis and balls

=== Digital Twin Examples

. Pacemaker (DToP)

* Track sensors inside pacemaker
* Given scanning of patient we can know how the pacemaker parameters will change
* Predictive optimization
** improve performance given predicted data
* Maintenance alerts

. Surgical procedure

* Pre-op planning
** model specific workslofs and decision points
* Resource optimization
** tracks resourece usage in different procedures
* Smart scheduling
// ** idk
* Continuous Improvement
** Identifies improvements over time

. Hospital System
* ER
** Intake
** Triage
** Stabilization
* Surgery
** OR scheduling
** resource allocation

All these need to be within 16ms to be considered REAL TIME

=== Digital Twins vs Traditional Models

* Realtime/continuous vs static/historical
* Automatic sync vs manual updates
* Dynamic prediction vs limited forecasting
* Bidirectional interaction vs unidirectional interaction

=== Digital Twins vs Metaverse 

// add later

=== Digital Model Layer Components

. Representation
* CAD model
** e.g. scanning heart of patient
* String
* Integer
* point clouds

. Behavioral models
* Physics simulations
* Mathematical models
* AI/ML algorithms

=== Application Layer Services

Gather emergent behavior from defined behaviors

* humans can do this
* AI agents can also do this

Use/do these things:

* Analytics and insights
* Predictive maintenance
* Control and optimization
* Descision support

== 3D Digitalization techniques

So many ways with differnt costs, invasiveness, accuracy and speed

=== Laser Scanning

3 main types

. Time of flight
* like radar but light

. Phase shift
* Checks difference between phases of out light and in light

. Point cloud generation
* Millions of points measure the distance from observer
* Can also use gen AI to reconstruct unseen objects
** Signed Distance Fields

Scanning operating rooms and such

=== Structured Light

Like Kinect

* Tooth prosthetics
